## Typing stubs for httplib2

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `httplib2` package. It
can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`httplib2`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/httplib2. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `ffa4999e3105778fac0271aa6b874c3e4d78d5fc`.
