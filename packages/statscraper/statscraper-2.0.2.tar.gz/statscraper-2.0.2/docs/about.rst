About Statscraper
=================

Statscraper is a base library for building web scrapers for statistical data, with a helper ontology for (primarily Swedish) statistical data. A set of ready-to-use scrapers are included. With Statscraper comes a unified interface for scraping, and some useful helper methods for scraper authors.

Statscraper is developed by Jens Finnäs and Leo Wallentin from Journalism++, and Robin Linderborg from SVT Nyheter.

The first stable version was released in August 2017. Statscraper is sponsored by Internetfonden/Stiftelsen för internetinfrastruktur and Journalism++ Stockholm.
