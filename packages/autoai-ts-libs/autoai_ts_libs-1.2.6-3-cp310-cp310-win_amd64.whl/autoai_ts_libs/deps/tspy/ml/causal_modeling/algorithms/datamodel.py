    """
    Base class for input data objects that are consumed by causal algorithms. 
    Causal algorithms included in the toolkit generally accept two types of data objects:
    (a) Multivariate Time series.
    (b) Timestamped event sequence. 
    
    For both above, in the base case, the input data is represented by a datamatrix of form (nsamples, nvariables) where each causal variable
    contributes a scalar feature value per time sample. In the general case, the input data is represented by a datamatrix of form 
    (nsamples, nvariables, nfeatures) where each causal variable can contribute a feature vector per time sample i.e. nfeatures >=1. 
    
    In case of (a), the time stamps are irrelevant and not processed by the algorithms. For e.g. if samples are collected at regular time steps. 
    In case of (b), the time stamps are relevant and are processed by the algorithms. Therefore these are stored.
    For e.g. if samples are collected at irregular time steps. 
    
    (a) and (b) are implemeted by inherited classes mts and tes respectively. 
    
    The functions create_dm and create_dm3d below are both capable of allocating space for general datamatrices where nfeatures >=1. 
    They only differ in the manner in which data would be stored: (nsamples x nvariables*nfeatures) versus (nsamples x nvariables x nfeatures). 
    Based on how the algorithms consume data, either of these 2 formats may be useful.
