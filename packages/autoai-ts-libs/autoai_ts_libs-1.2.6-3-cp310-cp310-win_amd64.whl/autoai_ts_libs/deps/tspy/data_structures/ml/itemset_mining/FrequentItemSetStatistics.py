    """
    container class representing Frequent-Itemset Statistics

    This class provides various statistics on the item-set, this is associated with the Frequent ItemSet Mining
    Algorithm. Statistics range from (1) Coverage, (2) Duration statistics

    Attributes
    ----------
    original_size : int
        indicating the number of sequences that match the itemset
    duration_statistics : :class:`autoai_ts_libs.deps.tspy.data_structures.ml.itemset_mining.DurationStatistics.DurationStatistics`
        statistics related to duration of match in time-series
    binary_match_normalized_frequency : int
        indicating number of matches in the set, where any number of matches for a given itemset counts as a single
        match
    multi_match_norm_frequency : int
        provides the total number of matches given a set of sets and a subset, with one
        set possibly matching a subset multiple times.
    coverage : float
        The coverage (binary_match_normalized_frequency / original_size) of the set for the FIM itemset
