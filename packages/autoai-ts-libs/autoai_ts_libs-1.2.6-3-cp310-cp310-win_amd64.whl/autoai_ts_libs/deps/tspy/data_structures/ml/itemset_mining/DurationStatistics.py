class DurationStatistics:
    """
    This is a deeper statistics holder class that maintains the duration statistics, where duration statistics is the
    duration of a given match in a time-series. The duration will be taken of each match, and a set of aggregates will
    be computed based on the all of the occurrences of that match.
