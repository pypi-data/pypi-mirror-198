class InterArrivalStatistics:
    """
    This is a deeper statistics holder class that maintains the inter-arrival times, where inter-arrival time is the time elapsed
    between two consecutive events in the subsequence. For every consecutive pair of events in a sequence, one inter-arrival
    statistics object is maintained. The values are across all the matching sequences for that single step in the subsequence.

    For example, if the subsequence is {a,b,c}, the interarrival statistics are maintained for {a,b} and {b,c}.

    sum : int
