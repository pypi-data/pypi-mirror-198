class DiscriminatorySubSequenceStatistics:
    """
    Container class representing Discriminatory-Sub-Sequence statistics

    This class provides various statistics on the DSM subsequence, this is associated with a DSM subsequence.
    Statistics range from (1) Coverage, (2) Lift, (3) Inter-arrival
    statistics (which can be used to analyze time spent between transitions from one element to another in the
    subsequence.

    Attributes
    ----------
    original_size_left : int
        indicating the number of sequences in L-set that match the DSM subsequence
    original_size_right : int
        indicating the number of sequences in R-set that match the DSM subsequence
    binary_match_normalized_frequency_left : int
        indicating number of matches in the L-set, where any number of matches for a given sequence counts as a single
        match
    binary_match_normalized_frequency_right : int
        indicating number of matches in the R-set, where any number of matches for a given sequence counts as a single
        match
    coverage_left : float
        The coverage (binary_match_normalized_frequency_left / original_size_left) of the L-set for the DSM subsequence
    coverage_right : float
        The coverage (binary_match_normalized_frequency_right / original_size_right) of the R-set for the DSM
        subsequence
    lift : float
        a measure indicating how many times the DSM subsequence is more likely to occur in L-set than R-set.
