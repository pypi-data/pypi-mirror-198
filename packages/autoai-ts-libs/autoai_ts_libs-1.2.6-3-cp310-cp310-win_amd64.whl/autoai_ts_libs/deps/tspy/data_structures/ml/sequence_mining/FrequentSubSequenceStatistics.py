class FrequentSubSequenceStatistics:
    """
    Container class representing Frequent-Sub-Sequence statistics

    This class provides various statistics on the FSM subsequence, this is associated with a FSM subsequence.
    Statistics range from (1) Coverage, (2) Inter-arrival
    statistics (which can be used to analyze time spent between transitions from one element to another in the
    subsequence.

    Attributes
    ----------
    original_size : int
        indicating the number of sequences that match the FSM subsequence
    binary_match_normalized_frequency : int
        indicating number of matches, where any number of matches for a given sequence counts as a single match
    coverage : float
        The coverage (binary_match_normalized_frequency / original_size) of the set for the FSM subsequence
    inter_arrival_statistics : list
        inter-arrival timing statistics for the FSM sequence
