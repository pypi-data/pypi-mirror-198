class TRS:
    """
    Time reference system (TRS) is a local, regional or global system used to identify time. A time reference system
    defines a specific projection for forward and reverse mapping between timestamp and its numeric representation. A
    common example that most of us are familiar with is UTC time, which maps a timestamp (Jan 1, 2019 12am midnight GMT)
    into a 64-bit integer value (1546300800000) that captures the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since
    Jan 1, 1970 12am (midnight) GMT. Generally speaking, the timestamp value is better suited for human readability,
    while the numeric representation is better suited for machine processing.

    Attributes
    ----------
    granularity : datetime.timedelta
        granularity that captures time-tick granularity (e.g., 1 minute)
    start_time : datetime
        start-time that captures an offset (e.g., 1st Jan 2019 12am midnight US Eastern Daylight Savings Time) to the
        start time of the time-series)

    Notes
    -----
    A timestamp is mapped into a numeric representation by computing the number of elapsed time-ticks since the
    offset. A numeric representation is scaled by the time-tick and shifted by the offset when it is mapped back to a
    timestamp.

    forward + reverse projections may be lossy. For instance, if the true time granularity of a
    time-series is in seconds, then forward and reverse mapping of timestamps 9:00:01 and 9:00:02 (to be read
    as hh:mm:ss) to a time-tick of one minute would result in timestamps 9:00:00 and 9:00:00 (respectively). In this
    example a time-series whose granularity is in seconds is being mapped to minutes and thus the reverse
    mapping looses information. However, the mapped granularity is higher than the granularity of the input
    time-series (more specifically if the time-series granularity is an integral multiple of the mapped
    granularity) then the forward + reverse projection is guaranteed to be lossless. For example, mapping a
    time-series whose granularity is in minutes to seconds and reverse projecting it to minutes would result
    in lossless reconstruction of the timestamps.

    By default, Granularity is one millisecond, and Start-Time is 1st Jan 1970 00:00:00
