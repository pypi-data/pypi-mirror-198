# CLIMATE RISK ANALYTICS PACKAGE


This package provides the following analytics which can be run end-to-end (retrieval to analytics output):
- carbon footprint (weighted average carbon intensity - WACI; financed emissions - TCE; owned emissions - OE) for the equity portfolio and benchmark and ftse all cap.
- share of equity nav which falls in each MSCI low carbon transition score
- implied temperature rise breakdown by sector and portfolio/benchmark total
- attribution of WACI for portfolio t vs portfolio t-1
- attribution of WACI for portfolio vs benchmark
- quality score
- country-sector change in data quality
- country-sector concentrations


#### PLEASE NOTE: if something looks like a bug, walks like a bug and calls(?) like a bug, it's probably a bug. Please contact Ginni to fix/discuss




## Structure, how to install, how to run:
This package provides 
- storages (getting data and validating)
- services (making calculations / analytics)


#### How to install: pip install git+https://github.com/NBIM/climate_risk.git
This will pick up every time a version is incremented.
#### How to run: All of these are united in the views folder. In order to run the analytics the user needs to run the scripts in the views, not the other files.
You can also use the services autonomously.


## Important notes on how to use this package:
- to run most analytics the user will need access to the underlying schemas and tables used.
- make sure to change the credentials to your snowflake account (email needed)
- scripts will run for specific portfolios (ftse all cap/eq portfolio/eq benchmark); specific fk_dim_date and specific ICB level. Make sure to change the variables at the beginning of the script to change any of these parameters.





## Future improvements:
- tests!
- remove storage from this package, keep only services. Or at least separate the two.
- generalise settings/configurations for constants and authorisations
- improve validations upon data retrieval
