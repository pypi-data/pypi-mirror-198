## Install

No dependencies required.

```
pip install -U python-shellrunner
```

## Usage

```python
from shellrunner import X

X("echo hello world")
# hello world
```

Easily get a command's output, do something with it, and run another command using the value:

```python
result = X("echo hello world | sed 's/world/there/'").out
greeting = result.capitalize()
X(f"echo 'echo {greeting}' >> .bashrc")
```

An exception is raised if a command exits with a non-zero status (like bash's `set -e`):

```python
X("curl https://invalid.url -o ~/super_important.tar.gz") # curl exits with exit status of 6
# ^ Raises ShellCommandError so the rest of the script doesn't run
X("tar -vxzf ~/super_important.tar.gz")
```

Or, maybe you want to handle the error:

```python
try:
    X("curl https://invalid.url -o ~/super_important.tar.gz")
except ShellCommandError:
    X("curl https://definitely-valid.url -o ~/super_important.tar.gz")
X("tar -vxzf ~/super_important.tar.gz")
```

Pipeline errors are not masked (like bash's `set -o pipefail`):

```python
X("grep hello /non/existent/file | tee new_file")
# ^ Raises ShellCommandError
```

## Why?

> Why not just use bash with `set -e` and `set -o pipefail`?

Because writing anything remotely complicated in bash kinda sucks :)

One of the primary advantages of ShellRunner's approach is that you can seamlessly swap between the shell and Python. Some things are just easier to do in a shell (e.g. pipelines) and a lot of things are easier/better in Python (control flow, error handling, etc).

Also, users of [fish](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell) might know that it [does not offer a way to easily exit a script if a command fails](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/510). ShellRunner adds `set -e` and `pipefail` like functionality to any shell. Leverage the improved syntax of your preferred shell and the (optional) saftey of bash.

ShellRunner is very similar to zxpy but aims to be more simple in its implementation and has a focus on adding safety to scripts.

## Advanced Usage

A note on compatability: ShellRunner should work with on any POSIX-compliant system (and shell). No Windows support at this time.

Confirmed compatible with `sh` (dash), `bash`, `zsh`, and `fish`.

Commands are automatically run with the shell that invoked your python script (this can be overridden):

```python
# my_script.py
X("echo hello | string match hello")
# Works if my_script.py is executed under fish. Will obviously fail if using bash.
```

`X` returns a `NamedTuple` containing the output of the command and a list of its exit status(es), accessed via `.out` and `.status` respectively.

```python
result = X("echo hello")
print(f'Got output "{result.out}" with exit status {result.status}')
# Or unpack
output, status = X("echo hello")
# output = "hello"
# status = [0]
```

`status` will contain the exit status of every command in a pipeline:

```python
statuses = X("echo hello | grep hello").status
# statuses = [0, 0]
```

If using a shell that does not support `PIPESTATUS` such as `sh`, you will only ever get the status of the last command in a pipeline. **This also means that in this case ShellRunner cannot detect if an error occured in a pipeline:**

```python
status = X("grep hello /non/existent/file | tee new_file").status
# if invoked with e.g. bash: ShellCommandError is raised
# if invoked with sh: No exception is raised and status = [0]
```

### Multiple Commands

Sometimes you might want to do something like this:

```python
# Pretend current working directory is ~/
X("curl https://definitely-valid.url -o /tmp/super_important.tar.gz")
X("cd /tmp/")
X("tar -vxzf super_important.tar.gz")
# ^ Raises exception because tar cannot find the file
```

This fails because each call of `X` invokes a new instance of the shell, so things like `cd` don't persist.

A (bad) solution would be to do this:

```python
X("""
curl https://definitely-valid.url -o /tmp/super_important.tar.gz
cd /tmp/
tar -vxzf super_important.tar.gz
""")
```

However, this sort of defeats the purpose of ShellRunner because that would be run as one command, so no error handling can take place.

Instead, `X` also accepts a list of commands:

```python
X([
"curl https://definitely-valid.url -o /tmp/super_important.tar.gz",
"cd /tmp/",
"tar -vxzf super_important.tar.gz"
])
# Works!
```

Each command is run in the same shell instance and goes through the normal error checking.

## Options

There are a few keyword arguments you can provide to adjust the behavior of `X`:

```python
X("command", shell="bash", check=True, show_output=True, show_commands=True)
```

`shell: str` (Default: the invoking shell) - Shell that will be used to execute the commands. Can be a path or simply the name (e.g. "/bin/bash", "bash").

`check: bool` (Default: True) - If True, an error will be thrown if a command exits with a non-zero status.

`show_output: bool` (Default: True) - If True, command output will be printed.

`show_commands: bool` (Default: True) - If True, the current command will be printed before execution.

### Output

Say you do this:

```python
X("echo hello world")
```

This will print the following to your terminal:

```
Executing: echo hello world
hello world
```

To hide the `Executing:` lines, set `show_commands=False`.

To hide actual command output, set `show_output=False`.

### Environment Variables

Each option also has a corresponding environment variable to allow you to set these options "globally" for your script:

`shell` = `SHELLRUNNER_SHELL`

`check` = `SHELLRUNNER_CHECK`

`show_output` = `SHELLRUNNER_SHOW_OUTPUT`

`show_commands` = `SHELLRUNNER_SHOW_COMMANDS`

Environment variables are evaluated on each call of `X`, so you could also do something like this:

```python
# Pretend that before running this file you set: export SHELLRUNNER_SHOW_OUTPUT="False"
X("echo hello")
# No output

# Now you want to see output
os.environ["SHELLRUNNER_SHOW_OUTPUT"] = "True"
X("echo hello")
# hello
```

## Examples

Prints out installed python packages and their dependencies:

```python
from shellrunner import X

packages = X("pip list -l | sed 1,2d | awk '{print $1}'").out
packages = packages.splitlines()

for package in packages:
    print(f"=== {package} ===")
    X(f"pip show {package} | grep -E 'Requires|Required-by'", show_commands=False)
```
