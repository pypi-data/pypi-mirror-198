_Corrects the spelling and grammar of your text using ChatGPT._

# Motivation

I have been using this CLI tool internally for a while now. It is not only good at correcting spelling and grammar in your text, but it is also excellent at simplifying complex technical language. Additionally, it perfectly complements [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/).

# Install

```bash
python3 -m pip install grammatical
```

# Usage

This tool **requires access to the [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/pricing)**. It utilizes the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model. When the spelling and grammar have been corrected, the resulting text will be automatically copied to the clipboard.

```bash
Usage: grammatical [OPTIONS]

  Corrects the spelling and grammar of your text using ChatGPT.

Options:
  --text TEXT               Text input for grammar correction
                            If --text flag is used, a prompt will be displayed to enter the text.
                            By default, the most recent text from the clipboard will be used.

  --api_key TEXT            OpenAI API Key
                            By default, key from the OPENAI_API_KEY env var will be used.

  --tone TEXT               Tone of the grammar correction  [default: "social media"]
                            This can be tuned in based on the context of the text.
                            E.g. "formal/informal setting", "academia", "reddit", etc.

  --simplify                Simplify the text

  -i, --input_format TEXT   Specify the input format  [default: text]
                            Useful when working with files like LaTeX, Markdown.

  -o, --output_format TEXT  Specify the output format  [default: text]
                            Useful when working with files like LaTeX, Markdown.

  --help                    Show this message and exit.
```

## Example

Using the defaults:

```
[09:34][~] # Text in clipboard: I walk to the store and I bought milk
[09:34][~] grammatical
Modified Text:
"I walked to the store and bought milk."
Text copied to clipboard.
[09:34][~]
```

With options:

```
[14:39][~] # Text in clipboard: This tool does need access to [OpenAI's API](https://openai.com/pricing). It uses the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model.
[14:40][~] grammatical --tone "documentation" -i "markdown" -o "markdown"
Modified Text:
 This tool requires access to [OpenAI's API](https://openai.com/pricing), utilizing the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model.
Text copied to clipboard.
[14:40][~]
```

# My MacOS Workflow

For my macOS workflow, I have [created a new `Application` in Automator](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/419767/how-to-create-a-shortcut-for-a-command-in-terminal-that-i-can-have-in-my-dock) that runs "Grammatical" for
convenience. I have also dragged it to the Dock.

Here is the AppleScript that I am using:

```applescript
tell application "Terminal"
    activate
    do script "grammatical"
end tell
```

If you are mostly concerned with the defaults, I highly recommend doing this.
