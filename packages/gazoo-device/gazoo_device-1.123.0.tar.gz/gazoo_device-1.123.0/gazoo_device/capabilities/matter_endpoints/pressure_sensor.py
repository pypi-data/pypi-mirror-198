"""Matter Pressure Sensor endpoint.

A Pressure Sensor device measures and reports the pressure of a fluid.

This endpoint module corresponds to the
"Pressure Sensor" Matter device type which defines required and optional
clusters in the Matter spec 1.0.

A Pressure Sensor endpoint houses an instance of Pressure Sensor Matter device
type with the following defined clusters on this endpoint:

The required clusters for this endpoint: Pressure Measurement
