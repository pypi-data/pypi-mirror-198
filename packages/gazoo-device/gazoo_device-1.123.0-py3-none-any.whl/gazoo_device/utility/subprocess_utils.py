  """Runs commands and streams the output at the same time.

  Python subprocess cannot capture and stream the output at the same time.
  Here we use Popen to pipe the output and log the output simultaneously.

  Args:
    cmd_args: Command args in a sequence.
    timeout: The timeout for running the commands.
    shell: Enables command to execute via shell.

  Returns:
    Tuple of (return code, string output).
    The caller is responsible for verifying that the subprocess invocation is
    successful by checking that the return code is zero and that the output
    doesn't contain any lines indicating a failure.

  Raises:
    subprocess.TimeoutExpired: If the subprocess time outs.
