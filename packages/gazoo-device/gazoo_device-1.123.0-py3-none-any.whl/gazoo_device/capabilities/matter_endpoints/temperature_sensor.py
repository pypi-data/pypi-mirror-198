"""Matter Temperature Sensor endpoint.

A Temperature Sensor device reports measurements of temperature.

This endpoint module corresponds to the
"Temperature Sensor" Matter device type which defines required and optional
clusters in the Matter spec 1.0.

A Temperature Sensor endpoint houses an instance of Temperature Sensor Matter
device type with the following defined clusters on this endpoint:

The required clusters for this endpoint: Temperature Measurement
