    What happened to prior versions (`<3`)?
    > *aprompt* started as a project with a slight different approach: All
    > prompts were decorators where each decorated function would take the
    > input invoked by the decorator. This version did not contain
    > formatters and whatsoever.
    > 
    > Version 2 is the origin of the latest version. While it had
    > formatters (called `themes`), the structure was not so pythonic
    > as it is now.

    What was the motivation of this project?
    > Most python libraries either use `input` or a library like
    > [python-inquirer](https://github.com/magmax/python-inquirer).
    > The first method does not look that good and is not that user
    > friendly. The latter one does not provide customization and a
    > dynamic control flow. For most projects this will probably
    > still suit your usage 😁.
