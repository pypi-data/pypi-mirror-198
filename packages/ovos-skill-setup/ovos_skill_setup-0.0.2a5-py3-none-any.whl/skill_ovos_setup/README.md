Setup your device, choose a voice and optionally connect to the Mycroft server


## About 

This skill will offer you the option to select Selene, Personal, or no backend, an offline or online STT as well choose the voice your device will use

The default backend to provide services for Mycroft users is [Selene](https://home.mycroft.ai/).  Pairing a device with Home provides access to privacy-protecting Speech to Text, Wolfram Alpha and other such services, as well as easy configuration for all your Mycroft devices.

This skill works better if you have mycroft-gui, in headless devices (voice only) options will be limited
