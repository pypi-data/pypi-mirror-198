The SONG Python REST SDK
************************

The SONG REST client is a simple python module that allows you to interact with a SONG server through Python, with a minimum of coding effort.

It lets you submit payloads, check their status and create analyses. From there, you can use the power of Python to process and analyze the data within those objects however you see fit.
