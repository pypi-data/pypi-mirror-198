![CLI_Tools](./CLI_Tools.png)

This repository contains all the **CLI tools** I custom made using python Cmd. These are now **Open-Sourced** under the **MIT** licence for anyone to customize and use depending on personal requirements. However, I've attached a setup file to make it easier, the process of configuring the system to be ready for using a tool among these.

# List of Tools

- **WorkMan (WorkSpace Manager)** ðŸ“š
    Manages workspaces for projects

- **Wizard (OpenAI ChatBots)** ðŸª„
    Answers questions with the help of `gpt-3.5-turbo` model.

> For more info on these check out [docs](https://github.com/developer-kush/CLI_Tools/tree/main/docs)


# Latest Features

- Added Chat History feature to Wizard.
Can be accessed using the commands, `cload`, `csave` and `crm`
- Bug fixes

## OR

# Setup

1. Clone the repository in your system using the command

3. If you're using Linux like me, you can make an alias for running the script using python,
In other case, if you're using Windows, you may prefer installing it using `pyinstaller` or run scripts directly using python3.
