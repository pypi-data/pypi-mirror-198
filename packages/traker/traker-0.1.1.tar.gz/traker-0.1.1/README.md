# TRAK: Attributing Model Behavior at Scale

In our recent [paper](TODO:link), we introduce `TRAK` (Tracing with the
Randomly-Projected After Kernel). In short, `TRAK` scores can make accurate
counterfactual predictions (e.g., answers to questions of the form â€œwhat would
happen to this prediction if these images were removed from the training set").
Furthermore, these scores come at a small fraction of the cost of prior methods
that are comparably effective (e.g., TRAK is 2-3 orders of magnitude cheaper
than comparable methods, on CIFAR-10 and QNLI):

## Usage

Check [our docs](https://trak.csail.mit.edu/html) for more detailed examples and
tutorials on how to use `TRAK`.  Below, we provide a brief blueprint of the
steps needed to get `TRAK` attribution scores with our API.

### Setting up the `TRAK` scorer

```python
from trak import TRAKer

model, checkpoints = ...
train_loader = ...

traker = TRAKer(model=model, task='image_classification', train_set_size=...)
```

### Getting `TRAK` features for the train data

```python
for model_id, checkpoint in enumerate(checkpoints):
  traker.load_checkpoint(ckeckpoint, model_id=model_id)
  for batch in loader_train:
      traker.featurize(batch=batch, ...)
traker.finalize_features()
```

### Getting `TRAK` scores

```python
targets_loader = ...

for model_id, checkpoint in enumerate(checkpoints):
  traker.start_scoring_checkpoint(ckeckpoint, model_id=model_id, num_targets=...)
  for batch in targets_loader:
    traker.score(batch=batch, ...)

scores = traker.finalize_scores()
```

## Installation

To install the version of our package which contains a fast, custom `CUDA`
kernel for the JL projection step, use
```bash
pip install traker[fast]
```
You will need compatible versions of `gcc` and `CUDA toolkit` to install it. See
the [installation FAQs](https://trak.csail.mit.edu/html/install.html) for tips
regarding this. To install the basic version of our package that requires no
compilation, use
```bash
pip install traker
```
