# Trello To Audit Report

A way to easily generate a markdown file from a trello board.

# Getting Started

## Requirements


- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `git --version` and you see a response like `git version x.x.x`
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  - You'll know you've installed python right if you can run:
    - `python --version` or `python3 --version` and get an output like: `Python x.x.x`
- [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/installation/)
  - `pipx` is different from [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)
  - You may have to close and re-open your terminal
  - You'll know you've installed it right if you can run:
    - `pipx --version` and see something like `x.x.x.x`


## Installation

There are a few options with how to install.

### pipx 

We recommend using `pipx` as it installs your package into a virtual environment. 

```
pipx install trello_to_audit_report
```

Then, verify it's installation: 
```
trello_to_audit_report -v
```

You should get an output like `x.x.x`

### pip

Otherwise, you can use `pip`.

```
pip install trello_to_audit_report
```

### From Source

You can install from source.

```
git clone https://github.com/ChainAccelOrg/trello_to_audit_report
cd trello_to_audit_report
pip install . -e
```

<!-- ### Just run as a script

And finally, if you want to just run it using the `python` command instead of as a cli, you can do the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/ChainAccelOrg/trello_to_audit_report
cd trello_to_audit_report
python3 
``` -->

## Quickstart

2. Place all your findings in a list on a trello board, and have one list called `Report`
3. [Export your board](https://support.atlassian.com/trello/docs/exporting-data-from-trello/) to a `.csv` file
4. Run:

```
trello_to_audit_report <PATH_TO_YOUR_CSV>
```

And you'll get a file named `output.md` with all your code formatted!

# More Resources

You can then, dump it into `pandoc` to generate a PDF. We have [a repo](https://github.com/ChainAccelOrg/audit-report-templating) that shows you how to do that as well.
