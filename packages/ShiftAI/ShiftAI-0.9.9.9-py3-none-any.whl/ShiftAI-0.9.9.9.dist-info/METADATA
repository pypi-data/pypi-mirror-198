##  Description
ShiftAI is a comprehensive Python package for implementing recommendation systems for load shifting in Home Assistant. It includes multiple agents designed to analyze and optimize energy usage patterns in households, providing intelligent suggestions for load shifting and reducing energy consumption.

The package contains a range of agents, each designed to cater to different aspects of energy management. These modules include data collection and preprocessing, agent-based modeling and simulation, and machine learning-based prediction and recommendation.

ShiftAI's agents work collaboratively to identify and predict patterns in household energy usage and provide real-time recommendations for shifting load to reduce peak demand and minimize energy costs. The package can also be customized to accommodate different household needs and preferences.

With ShiftAI, users can achieve a more efficient and sustainable household energy system while minimizing their carbon footprint. The package provides a user-friendly interface and can be easily integrated with Home Assistant, making it an ideal choice for homeowners looking to adopt smart energy management practices.
