# This is a .py "notebook in that it uses code cells
# from vs code, splitting cells with a "# %%" comment
# It's the same code that is represented by 
# hello_notebook.ipynb

# When we combine this with the nbdlang syntax to 
# describe how the notebook should be imported, it 
# becomes a potentially much more powerful document,
# with different representations based on the context.
# This extends the concept of a plain source file.
