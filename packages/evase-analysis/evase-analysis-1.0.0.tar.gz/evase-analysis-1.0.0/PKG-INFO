# Evase Analysis Library
This library intends to help users detect SQL Injection vulnerabilities from their source code. 
It has several structures that take-in Python source code (in .zip format) and use abstract-syntax trees (ASTs) to analyze for such vulnerabilities.

## Usage
This package was developed initially with the intention that it be used in the Backend for the Evase web-application,
so it is structured as such. To use it in a program, the user first needs to specify information pertaining to the project.

First the user defined a `ProjectStructure` object with the name and root directory of the project.

```python
from evase.structures.analysisperformer import AnalysisPerformer

code_analyzer = AnalysisPerformer(
    project_name="myProject",
    project_root="<filepath to root>"
)

code_analyzer.perform_analysis()

print(code_analyzer.get_results())

# optionally, output to JSON
code_analyzer.results_to_JSON("<output directory>")
```

## Installation
The package will be installable via PyPI. For now clone the repository, and run the following command:

`pip install .`
