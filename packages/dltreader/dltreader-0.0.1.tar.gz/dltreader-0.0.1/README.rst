=======

The `dltreader` Python module allows the reading of AUTOSAR
["Diagnostic, Log and Trace Protocol"](https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/standards/foundation/1-0/AUTOSAR_PRS_DiagnosticLogAndTraceProtocol.pdf) files.
files.


Why?
----

The goal of this module is to provide a simple, purely Python-based module to
read `.dlt` files without further dependencies. Apart from that a permissive
free software license shall is supported to make it usable in possible
commercial contexts.


Limitations
-----------

At current point in time the module is a PoC so should not be used in
production software; besides, it is only a partial implementation of the
overall standard and not optimized for performance.
