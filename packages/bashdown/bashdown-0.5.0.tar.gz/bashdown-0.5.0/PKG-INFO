# bashdown

A markdown pre-processor for inline bash.

Have you ever written a command line tool and wanted to include it's output
in your documentation?

Then bashdown is for you.

Write your markdown files as usual and include bash code sections as normal
using "```bash".

When you pass this file through bashdown, it will run the code in the
code block and include that output inside the rest of the markdown.

This README.md was generated using bashdown.
Check README.bashdown for the file that's used to generate README.md

This project was inspired by tools like quarto and Rmarkdown, but has
significantly fewer dependencies due to it's much more limited scope.
