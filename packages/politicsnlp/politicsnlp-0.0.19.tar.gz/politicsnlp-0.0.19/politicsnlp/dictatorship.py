class Dictatorship:
    """
    Dictatorship is a form of government where a single person or a small group of people hold absolute power and authority over a country or state. The following are some important characteristics of dictatorship:

    One-person or small group rule: In a dictatorship, power is concentrated in the hands of one person or a small group of people. This group exercises complete control over the government and its policies.
    No free and fair elections: Dictators do not allow free and fair elections, and they may use force or coercion to stay in power. Opposition parties or candidates may be banned, suppressed, or eliminated.
    Limited or no civil liberties: Dictatorships may limit or eliminate civil liberties, such as freedom of speech, assembly, and religion. The government may also control the media and restrict access to information.
    Use of force: Dictators may use force or violence to maintain their hold on power. This can include the use of secret police, torture, and arbitrary detention.
    Based on these characteristics, we can create a Python class for a dictatorship:
