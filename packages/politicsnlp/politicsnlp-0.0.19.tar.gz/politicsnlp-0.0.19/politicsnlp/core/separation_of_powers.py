class SeparationOfPowers:
    """
    Separation of Powers is a political concept that refers to the distribution of political power among different branches or levels of government, to ensure balance and prevent the abuse of power. It typically includes the following features:

    Branches of Government: The political power is divided into different branches of government, such as executive, legislative, and judiciary, each with different responsibilities and functions.
    Levels of Government: The power is distributed at different levels of government, such as national, state, and local, to ensure balance and prevent the concentration of power at one level.
    Checks and Balances: The different branches and levels of government should have checks and balances on each other to prevent the abuse of power and ensure balance. For example, the legislative branch can check the power of the executive branch through veto power.
    Transparency: The decision-making process should be open and transparent, to promote public participation and oversight.
