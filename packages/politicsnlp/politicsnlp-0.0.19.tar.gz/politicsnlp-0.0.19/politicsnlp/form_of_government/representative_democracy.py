    Representative democracy is a form of government where citizens elect representatives to make decisions on their behalf. Here are some key features of representative democracy:

    Elections: Elections are held regularly to choose representatives who will make decisions on behalf of the citizens.
    Representation: The elected representatives are responsible for representing the interests of their constituents.
    Separation of powers: There is a separation of powers between the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government.
    Protection of minority rights: Representative democracy aims to protect the rights of minorities and prevent the majority from dominating.
    Free and fair elections: The electoral process should be free and fair, with all citizens having the right to vote and express their opinions.
