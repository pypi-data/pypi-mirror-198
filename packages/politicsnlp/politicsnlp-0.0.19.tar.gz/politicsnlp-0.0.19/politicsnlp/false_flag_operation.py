class FalseFlagOperation:
    """
A false flag operation is a covert operation that is designed to deceive the public or a government into believing that a particular group or nation is responsible for an act of violence or terrorism when in fact it is not. Here are some key features of a false flag operation:

The operation is intended to deceive people into thinking that the attack was carried out by someone else.
The attackers often disguise themselves as members of a different group or nation.
The operation is usually carried out in a way that maximizes the shock value and the impact on public opinion.
The operation is often followed by a quick and forceful response from the government or military, which may lead to further conflict.
