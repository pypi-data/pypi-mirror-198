Political purges, also known as political cleansings or purges, refer to the systematic removal of individuals deemed to be disloyal or otherwise undesirable from positions of power or influence. Some common features of political purges include:

Targeting of specific groups: Political purges often target specific groups or individuals who are perceived as disloyal or threatening to those in power.
Use of propaganda: Political purges may be accompanied by propaganda campaigns aimed at discrediting and demonizing the targeted groups or individuals.
Suspension of due process: Political purges often involve the suspension of due process and the use of extrajudicial methods to remove the targeted individuals from their positions of power or influence.
Consolidation of power: Political purges are often carried out by those seeking to consolidate power, by removing potential challengers or critics.
Long-term impacts: Political purges can have long-term impacts on the political and social fabric of a society, by removing key figures and disrupting the balance of power.
