    """
    People's democracy and democracy are two different types of government systems. People's democracy typically refers to a socialist form of government, in which the people have more direct control over decision-making and the economy, while democracy is a system of government in which the people have the power to elect representatives to make decisions on their behalf.

    Democracy is characterized by several key features, including:

    - Political equality: All citizens have equal political rights, including the right to vote, run for office, and participate in the political process.
    - Civil liberties: Citizens have the right to freedom of speech, religion, and assembly, as well as other fundamental rights such as due process and the right to a fair trial.
    - Rule of law: The government is bound by the law, and all individuals are equal before the law.
    - Checks and balances: The government is structured to include separate branches that are responsible for checking and balancing one another to prevent the concentration of power.
    - Transparency and accountability: The government is transparent in its decision-making processes and is accountable to the people it represents.
