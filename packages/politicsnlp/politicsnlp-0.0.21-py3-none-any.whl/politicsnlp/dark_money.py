    """
    Dark money, also known as dark politics or dark funding, is a term used to describe political spending by groups or individuals that is not disclosed to the public. The main features of dark money politics include:

    Lack of transparency: Dark money groups are not required to disclose their donors or their spending activities to the public, which can lead to corruption and the distortion of the democratic process.
    Influence on elections: Dark money groups can spend unlimited amounts of money on political campaigns, which can influence the outcome of elections and undermine the integrity of the electoral process.
    Use of nonprofit status: Dark money groups often operate as non-profit organizations, which allows them to receive tax-exempt status and avoid scrutiny from regulators.
    Covert operations: Dark money groups often engage in covert operations, such as creating shell companies or using anonymous donors, to conceal their activities.
