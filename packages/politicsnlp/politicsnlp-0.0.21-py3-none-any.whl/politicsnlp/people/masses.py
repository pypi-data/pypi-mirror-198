    In politics, "the masses" refers to a large group of people who share common social, economic, or political conditions. The masses can be characterized by several features, including:

    - Lack of organization: The masses are typically unorganized and lack a clear leadership structure.

    - Heterogeneity: The masses are often composed of individuals from diverse backgrounds, with different needs and interests.

    - Political consciousness: The masses may have a general sense of dissatisfaction or grievance with the current political or economic system, but may not have a clear idea of how to address these issues.
    
    - Potential for mobilization: The masses have the potential to be mobilized into collective action, such as protests, strikes, or revolutions.
