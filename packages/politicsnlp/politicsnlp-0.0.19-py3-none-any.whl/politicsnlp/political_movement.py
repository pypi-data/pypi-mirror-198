Organization: Political movements typically have a hierarchical structure, with leaders and members who work together to achieve their goals. They may have formal or informal systems of governance and decision-making.
Mobilization: Political movements often seek to mobilize large numbers of people to support their cause. This can involve organizing rallies, protests, or other forms of collective action to raise awareness and build momentum.
Media and Communication: Political movements often rely on media and communication strategies to get their message out to a wider audience. This can involve social media campaigns, traditional media coverage, or other forms of public relations.
Activism: Political movements typically involve a high degree of activism and engagement from their members. This can include participating in protests or rallies, engaging in civil disobedience, or advocating for political change through other means.
