class TyrannyOfTheMajority:
    """
    Tyranny of the majority, also known as majority tyranny or the oppressive rule of the majority, refers to a situation in which the majority of an electorate uses its power to make decisions or pass laws that oppress a particular minority group. The main features of tyranny of the majority include:

    - Minority oppression: The decisions made by the majority are often at the expense of the minority, who may be deprived of their basic rights or subjected to discrimination.

    - Exclusion: The minority group is often excluded from the political process and cannot effectively defend their rights or interests.

    - Demagoguery: The majority may be swayed by populist demagogues who appeal to their fears and prejudices, rather than to reason and justice.

    - Legalization: The tyranny of the majority may be legalized through the democratic process, and become entrenched in the political system.
