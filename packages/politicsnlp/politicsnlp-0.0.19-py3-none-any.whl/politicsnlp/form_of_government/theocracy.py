    Religious leadership: The government is led by religious leaders, who hold supreme power and authority.
    Religious law: The society is governed by religious law and doctrine, which may supersede secular laws and principles.
    Integration of religion and government: Religion and government are closely intertwined, with the religious leaders often holding positions of political power.
    Limited or no political participation: The general population has limited or no political participation, and decisions are made by the religious leaders.
    Divine authority: The religious leaders often claim to have divine authority to govern the society and make decisions on behalf of the population.
