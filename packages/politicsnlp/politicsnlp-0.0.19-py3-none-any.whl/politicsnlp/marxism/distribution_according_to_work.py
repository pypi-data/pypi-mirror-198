    """
    Distribution according to work, also known as the principle of "to each according to his work", is a concept in socialist and communist political theory. The main features of distribution according to work include:

    - Rewarding labor: The distribution of goods and services is based on an individual's contribution to society through their labor, rather than on their personal wealth, inheritance, or other non-labor-related factors.
    
    - Equality: The principle of distribution according to work emphasizes the importance of equality in society, as all individuals have an equal opportunity to contribute to society through their labor.
    
    - Meritocracy: The system rewards individuals based on their merit and contribution to society, rather than on their social status or connections.
    
    - Collective ownership: In socialist and communist societies, the means of production and distribution are collectively owned and managed by the state or the community, and the fruits of labor are distributed accordingly.
