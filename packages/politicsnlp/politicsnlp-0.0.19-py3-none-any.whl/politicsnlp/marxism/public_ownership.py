class PublicOwnership:
    """
    Public ownership is a form of economic and social organization in which the means of production and distribution are owned and controlled by the state or the community as a whole. The main features of public ownership include:

    - Collective ownership: The means of production and distribution are collectively owned and controlled by the state or the community, rather than by private individuals or corporations.
    
    - Social and economic planning: Public ownership is often associated with centralized planning of social and economic activities, as the state or community determines how resources are allocated and distributed.
    
    - Public welfare: Public ownership aims to provide public goods and services for the benefit of society as a whole, rather than maximizing profits for private interests.
    
    - Democratic control: In a truly public ownership system, the state or the community exercises democratic control over the means of production and distribution.
