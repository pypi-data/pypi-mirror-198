class Power:
    """
    #### A class that represents power in political science, which is the ability of an actor to influence the behavior of other actors in a way that serves its interests. Power can be manifested in various forms, including military, economic, political, and cultural. It can be exercised through coercion, persuasion, or the ability to set the agenda and control the terms of the debate. Power is often distributed unequally among actors in a given system, and the balance of power can shift over time in response to changing circumstances.

    Attributes:
        type (str): The type of power, e.g. military, economic, political, cultural.
        distribution (dict): The distribution of power among actors in a given system.
        balance (float): The balance of power in a given system.

    Methods:
        __init__(type, distribution, balance): Initializes an instance of the class with the given attributes.
        exercise_power(method): Implements the exercise of power using the given method.
        shift_balance(new_balance): Implements the shifting of the balance of power in response to changing circumstances.
