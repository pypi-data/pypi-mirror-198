class Justice:
    """
    ### There are several key characteristics of justice, including:

    - Impartiality: Justice must be impartial and unbiased. It should not favor one person or group over another, but rather treat all individuals equally.
    - Fairness: Justice must be fair, and ensure that people are given what they are due. This includes equal treatment under the law and equal access to resources and opportunities.
    - Transparency: Justice should be transparent, with clear rules and procedures that are accessible to all individuals. It should also involve open and honest communication and decision-making.
    - Accountability: Justice should hold people accountable for their actions, and ensure that they are held responsible for any harm they cause.
    - Human dignity: Justice should respect the inherent dignity of all individuals and ensure that their rights are protected.
