Social liberals often support policies such as universal healthcare, public education, and progressive taxation. They also prioritize the protection of minority rights, such as those of ethnic and sexual minorities.
    
    Social liberalism and liberalism both emphasize individual freedom and the role of government intervention, but there are some differences between the two.Liberalism is a political philosophy and ideology that believes that the government should intervene in the lives of citizens as minimally as possible to protect individual rights and freedoms. Liberals typically advocate for free markets, small government, and individual responsibility. They believe that economic freedom is key to protecting human rights, while also advocating for personal freedom within the framework of social morality and law.Social liberalism also emphasizes the role of government, but it emphasizes that the government should intervene more actively to ensure fairness and social justice. Social liberals typically advocate for big government, taxation, and public welfare. They believe that the government should not only protect individual rights but also solve social inequality and poverty issues by providing welfare and services.
