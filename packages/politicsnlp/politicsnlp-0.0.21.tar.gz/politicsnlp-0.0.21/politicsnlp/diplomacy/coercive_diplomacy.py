The use of threats: A reliance on threats of military force, economic sanctions, or other forms of coercion to influence the behavior of other countries.
The use of incentives: The use of incentives, such as economic or political benefits, to encourage other countries to comply with demands or expectations.
A willingness to use military force: A readiness to use military force if necessary to achieve diplomatic objectives.
Limited engagement: A preference for limited diplomatic engagement, avoiding formal negotiations and instead relying on behind-the-scenes communications or intermediaries.
A focus on short-term objectives: A focus on achieving short-term objectives or resolving immediate crises, rather than addressing underlying issues or long-term challenges.
