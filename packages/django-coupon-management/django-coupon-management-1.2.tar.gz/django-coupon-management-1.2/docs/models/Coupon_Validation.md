# Coupon Validations

Every coupon needs a set of rules to make it valid and useable.
For now, django-simple-coupons use three basic rules:

##### Valid User:

Defines which users are allowed to use the coupon.


##### Max Usage Count:

Defines how many uses the coupon should have in general and for each user.


##### Validity rule:

Defines the expiration date for the coupon and if it's active or not.
