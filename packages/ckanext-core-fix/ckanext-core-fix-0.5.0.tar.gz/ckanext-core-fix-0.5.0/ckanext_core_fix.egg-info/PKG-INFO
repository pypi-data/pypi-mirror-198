# ckanext-core-fix

This extensions comes to provide temprorary fixes to CKAN core that isn't yet applied, but will be (probably) applied soon.

By default, all the fixes are enabled. Check the **List of fixes** and **Config settings**
section to understand how to disabled specific fix.

All the fixes must be associated with a PR to the CKAN core.

Merged fixes could be deleted from this extension with new versions, as I don't
want to store them forever and increase the list of disabled fixes in config.
