class TradeWar:
    """
Trade war is a type of economic conflict between two or more countries characterized by the following features:

Trade barriers: Trade wars often involve the use of trade barriers such as tariffs, quotas, and embargoes to restrict or block imports and exports between countries.
Retaliation: Countries engage in a trade war often in response to perceived unfair trade practices by their trading partners. As such, one of the key features of trade wars is the retaliatory measures taken by each country involved.
Political motives: Trade wars may also be driven by political motives, such as national security concerns or a desire to protect domestic industries and jobs.
Escalation: Trade wars can escalate quickly, as one country's actions can trigger retaliatory measures by its trading partners, leading to a cycle of escalating trade barriers.
Economic impact: Trade wars can have significant economic impacts, including higher costs for consumers, reduced trade and investment flows, and potential job losses.
Based on these features, here's an example Python class that can be used to simulate a trade war:    
    """
    def __init__(self, country1, country2, initial_tariffs):
        self.country1 = country1
        self.country2 = country2
        self.tariffs = {country1: initial_tariffs, country2: initial_tariffs}

    def escalate(self):
        # Increase tariffs for both countries
        self.tariffs[self.country1] *= 2
        self.tariffs[self.country2] *= 2

    def retaliate(self, country):
        # Increase tariffs for the specified country
        self.tariffs[country] *= 2

    def impact(self):
        # Compute the economic impact of the trade war
        # This is just a simple example calculation
        total_tariffs = sum(self.tariffs.values())
        impact = total_tariffs / 10
        return impact
