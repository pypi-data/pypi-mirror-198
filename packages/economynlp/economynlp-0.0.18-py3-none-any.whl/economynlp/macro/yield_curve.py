class YieldCurve:
    """
    #### A class representing the yield curve, a graphical representation of the yields on bonds of different maturities.
    
    The yield curve is a graphical representation of the yields on bonds of different maturities, typically for US Treasury securities. It is a key indicator of the state of the economy and the expectations for future economic growth and inflation. Normally, the yield curve is upward sloping, with longer-term bonds having higher yields than shorter-term bonds, reflecting the expectation of higher inflation and higher growth in the future. In rare cases, the yield curve can be inverted, with shorter-term bonds having higher yields than longer-term bonds, which is often seen as a warning sign of an impending recession.
    
    Attributes:
    - treasury_securities (str): The type of US Treasury securities used to construct the yield curve.
    - maturities (list): A list of the maturities of the bonds used to construct the yield curve.
    - yields (list): A list of the yields on the bonds used to construct the yield curve.
    
    Methods:
    - plot_yield_curve(): Plots the yield curve using matplotlib.
    - calculate_slope(): Calculates the slope of the yield curve, a key indicator of the state of the economy.
    - identify_inverted_yield_curve(): Identifies an inverted yield curve, which is often seen as a warning sign of an impending recession.
