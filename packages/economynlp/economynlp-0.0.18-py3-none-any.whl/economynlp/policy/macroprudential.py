Macroprudential refers to policies and measures that aim to promote the stability of the financial system as a whole, rather than just focusing on individual institutions or markets. The goal of macroprudential policy is to prevent or mitigate systemic risks that can arise from interconnectedness and common exposures in the financial system.

Macroprudential policies can take many forms, including capital and liquidity requirements, loan-to-value limits, countercyclical buffers, and stress tests. These policies are often implemented by central banks or other financial regulators.
