    #### A class representing a financial crisis, which is a severe and often sudden disruption
    in the stability or functioning of financial markets, institutions, or economies.

    Features:
    - Identify the cause and nature of the financial crisis.
    - Analyze the impact of the crisis on asset prices, liquidity, and volatility.
    - Help policymakers, investors, and financial institutions mitigate risks and implement
      measures to prevent or manage future crises.

    Attributes:
    - start_date (datetime.date): The approximate start date of the financial crisis.
    - end_date (datetime.date): The approximate end date of the financial crisis.
    - description (str): A brief description of the financial crisis.

    Methods:
    - analyze_impact(): Analyze the impact of the financial crisis on asset prices, liquidity, and volatility.
    - generate_policy_recommendations(): Generate policy recommendations to prevent or manage future crises.
