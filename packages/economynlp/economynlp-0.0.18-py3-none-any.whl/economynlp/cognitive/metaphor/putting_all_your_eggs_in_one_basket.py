    """
"Putting All Your Eggs in One Basket" is an idiomatic expression used to describe the act of investing all of one's resources or relying on a single strategy or approach, without having a backup plan. It implies that if the strategy fails, all of the resources will be lost.

Some of the characteristics of "Putting All Your Eggs in One Basket" are:

Risky: It involves a high level of risk because if the strategy fails, all of the resources will be lost.
Lack of diversification: There is no diversification of resources or investments, which means that all of the eggs are in one basket.
Lack of contingency plan: There is no backup plan if the strategy fails.
