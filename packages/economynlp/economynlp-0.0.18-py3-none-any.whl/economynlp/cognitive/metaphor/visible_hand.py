class VisibleHand:
    """
    In economics, the visible hand refers to the role of government in regulating and controlling the market economy. The concept of the visible hand is in contrast to the invisible hand, which refers to the self-regulating nature of the market through supply and demand forces without government intervention.

    The visible hand is based on the belief that government intervention is necessary to correct market failures, such as externalities and market power, and to provide public goods that would otherwise be underprovided by the private sector. The visible hand can also be used to promote economic growth and development through targeted policies, such as investment in infrastructure and education.

    The visible hand has been a subject of debate among economists, with some arguing that it is necessary to correct market failures and ensure a more just and equitable society, while others believe that it can lead to inefficiencies and unintended consequences."
