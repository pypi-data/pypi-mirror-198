class ComparativeAdvantage:
    """
 The Law of Comparative Advantage is an economic principle that states that countries should specialize in producing the goods and services in which they have the lowest opportunity cost, and trade with other countries to obtain the goods and services they cannot produce as efficiently. Some of the characteristics of the Law of Comparative Advantage include:

Opportunity cost: The Law of Comparative Advantage is based on the concept of opportunity cost, which refers to the cost of giving up one alternative to pursue another. Countries should specialize in the production of goods and services with the lowest opportunity cost, meaning the goods and services that they can produce at a lower cost than other countries.
Trade: The Law of Comparative Advantage predicts that countries will benefit from trading with each other, as they can obtain goods and services at a lower cost than if they were to produce them domestically.
Efficiency: The Law of Comparative Advantage promotes efficiency in the global economy, as each country can focus on producing the goods and services in which they have a comparative advantage, leading to greater specialization and economies of scale.
