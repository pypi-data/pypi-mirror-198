    """
 Productivity shocks refer to sudden changes in the efficiency or output of an economy or industry. Productivity shocks are characterized by the following features:

 Suddenness: Productivity shocks occur suddenly and unexpectedly, often due to factors such as technological breakthroughs, natural disasters, or changes in government policies.
 Magnitude: Productivity shocks can have significant impacts on the economy or industry, with the magnitude of the shock depending on the size and nature of the shock.
 Spillover effects: Productivity shocks can also have spillover effects, affecting other sectors of the economy or industries that are closely related to the affected sector.
 Adjustment costs: In the short run, productivity shocks can result in adjustment costs as firms and workers adapt to the new productivity level. For example, firms may need to restructure their production processes, while workers may need to learn new skills or find new jobs.
 Economic impact: Productivity shocks can have significant economic impacts, affecting output, employment, and wages, as well as leading to changes in trade patterns and competitiveness.
