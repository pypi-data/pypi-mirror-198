class Tariffs:
    """
 Tariffs are a type of trade barrier that can be imposed by a government on imported goods. Tariffs are characterized by the following features:

 Tax on imports: Tariffs are essentially a tax on imports, which raises the price of the imported goods for consumers in the importing country.
 Protectionism: Tariffs are often used to protect domestic industries from foreign competition. By raising the price of imported goods, tariffs can make domestically produced goods more competitive.
 Revenue source: Tariffs can also be a source of revenue for governments. The revenue generated from tariffs can be used to fund various government programs and initiatives.
 Trade retaliation: Tariffs can also be used as a tool of trade retaliation, whereby a country imposes tariffs on imports from another country in response to that country's own tariffs or other trade barriers.
 Economic impact: Tariffs can have significant economic impacts, including higher costs for consumers, reduced trade and investment flows, and potential job losses.
