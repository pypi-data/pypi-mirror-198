class RationalBeliefs:
    """
 Rational beliefs refer to beliefs or expectations that are formed based on reasoned analysis and accurate information, and are consistent with economic theory. Rational beliefs are characterized by the following features:

 Objectivity: Rational beliefs are objective, meaning that they are based on accurate information and reasoned analysis, rather than subjective biases or emotions.
 Consistency: Rational beliefs are consistent with economic theory and do not contain internal contradictions or inconsistencies.
 Adaptability: Rational beliefs are adaptable and responsive to changes in economic conditions, as new information becomes available or economic conditions change.
 Transparency: Rational beliefs are transparent, meaning that they are based on information that is publicly available and can be verified by others.
 Economic impact: Rational beliefs can lead to optimal decision-making and efficient market outcomes, with positive economic impacts.
