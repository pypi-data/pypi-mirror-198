class MarketFailure(Market):
    """
 Market failure refers to a situation where the allocation of resources in a market is inefficient, leading to suboptimal outcomes. Market failure is characterized by the following features:

 Externalities: Market failure can arise due to externalities, which occur when the actions of one agent in a market have unintended costs or benefits on others, leading to an inefficient allocation of resources.
 Public goods: Market failure can also occur with public goods, which are goods that are non-excludable and non-rivalrous, meaning that individuals cannot be excluded from using them and one person's use does not reduce the amount available to others. This can lead to underproduction or underinvestment in public goods.
 Market power: Market failure can arise due to market power, which occurs when a single firm or group of firms has the ability to influence market outcomes and set prices above the competitive level, leading to an inefficient allocation of resources.
 Information asymmetry: Market failure can also arise from information asymmetry, where different individuals have different levels of information about a situation, leading to suboptimal decisions and inefficient market outcomes.
 Economic impact: Market failure can lead to inefficient allocation of resources, with negative economic impacts such as lower output, higher prices, and lower welfare.
