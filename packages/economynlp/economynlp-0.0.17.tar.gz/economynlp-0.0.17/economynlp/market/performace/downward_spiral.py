class DownwardSpiral:
    """
    #### A class to represent the concept of a downward spiral in finance.
    
    Features:
    - Vicious circle: Negative events or impacts lead to further negative events or impacts, forming a vicious circle.
    - Gradual deterioration: The situation gradually worsens, typically in a progressive manner, rather than suddenly occurring.
    - Hard to control: The situation becomes increasingly difficult to control and may exceed people's ability to manage.
    - Cross-effects: Problems in one area may affect other areas, exacerbating the situation even further.

    Attributes:
    - events (list): A list of events or impacts that lead to further negative impacts.

    Methods:
    - get_spiral(): Returns a message describing the downward spiral.
