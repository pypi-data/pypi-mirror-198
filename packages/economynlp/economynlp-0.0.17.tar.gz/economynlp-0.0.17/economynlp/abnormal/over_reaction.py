class Overreaction:
    """
Overreaction in economics refers to the tendency of investors to overreact to news or information about the market, leading to price fluctuations that are not justified by underlying economic fundamentals. Some of the characteristics of overreaction include:

Behavioral bias: Overreaction is often attributed to behavioral biases such as herding behavior or confirmation bias.
Volatility: Overreaction can lead to increased market volatility and higher trading volumes.
Market inefficiency: Overreaction suggests that the market is not always efficient, as prices can deviate from underlying economic fundamentals.
Correction: Overreaction can sometimes lead to a correction in prices, as investors adjust their expectations and new information is incorporated into the market.
