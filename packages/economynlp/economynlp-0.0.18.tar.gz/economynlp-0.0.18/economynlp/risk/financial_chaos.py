class FinancialChaos:
    """
    #### A class representing financial chaos, which analyzes the unpredictable and seemingly
    random behavior of financial markets or assets.

    Features:
    - Analyze complex and non-linear patterns in market data.
    - Identify underlying structures or trends obscured by noise or fluctuations.

    Attributes:
    - market_data (pandas.DataFrame): A DataFrame containing historical market data, with columns
                                      representing various financial assets and rows representing time periods.

    Methods:
    - analyze_patterns(): Analyze patterns in the market data and identify potential structures or trends.
    - predict_future(): Make predictions about future market behavior based on identified patterns or trends.
