 Unemployment insurance is a social welfare program designed to provide financial assistance to individuals who have lost their jobs and are actively seeking employment. Some of the key features of unemployment insurance include:

Eligibility criteria: To be eligible for unemployment insurance benefits, individuals must have lost their job through no fault of their own and must be actively seeking employment.
Benefit levels: Unemployment insurance benefits typically provide a percentage of the individual's previous earnings, up to a maximum amount set by the program.
Duration of benefits: Unemployment insurance benefits are typically provided for a limited duration, usually between 26 weeks and one year, depending on the program.
Funding: Unemployment insurance programs are funded through payroll taxes paid by employers.
Effect on labor market: Unemployment insurance can have an impact on the labor market by providing a safety net for individuals who have lost their jobs, but also potentially reducing incentives to work.
