class SafeHaven:
    """
    #### A class representing a safe haven, a financial asset or investment that is perceived to be low risk.
    
    A safe haven is a financial asset or investment that is perceived to be low risk, and is therefore sought after by investors during times of economic or geopolitical uncertainty. Safe havens are typically highly liquid and have a low correlation with other assets in a portfolio, providing diversification benefits. Common safe havens include gold, US Treasury bonds, and the Japanese yen. Safe havens are often characterized by their ability to maintain their value or appreciate during periods of market stress, and their low volatility compared to other assets.
    
    Attributes:
    - name (str): The name of the safe haven asset or investment.
    - liquidity (float): A measure of the ease with which the safe haven asset or investment can be bought or sold.
    - correlation (float): A measure of the correlation between the safe haven asset or investment and other assets in a portfolio.
    - volatility (float): A measure of the degree of variation of the safe haven asset or investment's price over time.
    
    Methods:
    - measure_performance(): Measures the performance of the safe haven asset or investment during periods of market stress.
    - identify_correlations(): Identifies correlations between the safe haven asset or investment and other assets in a portfolio.
    - analyze_volatility(): Analyzes the volatility of the safe haven asset or investment compared to other assets.
