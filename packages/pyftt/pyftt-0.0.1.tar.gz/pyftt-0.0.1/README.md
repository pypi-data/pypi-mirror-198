Fast Tensor Trace

Julio Candanedo

The Fast-Tensor-Trace algorthim is implemented here in pure python (+numpy with no other dependecies).
The purpose is to trace two multidimensional sparse-arrays (arrays with mostly 0s) similar to 
numpy.einsum function for dense (regular) numpy.arrays.

Main Aspects of the Code are:
1. sparse-array class defintion
2. the ftt function
