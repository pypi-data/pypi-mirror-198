Factur-X is the same standard than ZUGFeRD 2.2.\n\nFactur-X is at the same time a full readable invoice in a PDF A/3 format, containing all information useful for its treatment, especially in case of discrepancy or absence of automatic matching with orders and / or receptions, and a set of invoice data presented in an XML structured file conformant to EN16931 (syntax CII D16B), complete or not, allowing invoice process automation.\n\nThe first objective of Factur-X is to enable suppliers, invoice issuers, to create added-value e-invoices, containing a maximum of information in structured form, according to their ability to produce them in this form, and to let customers recipients free to use the invoice data and / or the readable presentation, depending on their needs and their invoice process maturity on automation.\n\n### order-x\n\nOrder-X is the implementation of Factur-X for purchase orders.\n\n## Installation\n\n(tbd)\n\n## Usage\n\n(tbd)\n\n## License\n\nThis library is published under the MIT licence\n\n\n',
