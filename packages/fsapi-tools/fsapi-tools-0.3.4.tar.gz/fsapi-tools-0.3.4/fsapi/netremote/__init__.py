The next module of this small API implementation focusses on the ``FsNetRemoteLib``. 
All nodes that are presented here were converted from the Java-source code of the app 
Medion Lifestream 2. 

The script used for converting the code is placed `here`_. The source code was converted,
because nodes.py contains more that 4000 lines of code in the end (to much work by hand).

When querying a resource or trying to set value to a specific node, there is always a status
message that comes along with the response. The possible values for this status are:

+-------------------------+-------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Status                  | Body  | Description                                               |
+=========================+=======+===========================================================+
| `FS_OK`                 | True  | If everything goes right the status is set to `FS_OK`     |
+-------------------------+-------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| `FS_PACKET_BAD`         | False | This status code will be returned if a value should be    |
|                         |       | applied to a read-only node.                              |
+-------------------------+-------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| `FS_NODE_BLOCKED`       | False | Sometimes this status is given, maybe because the node    |
|                         |       | was deactivated on the device.                            |
+-------------------------+-------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
|`FS_NODE_DOES_NOT_EXIST` | False | As the name already states, the requested node is not     |
|                         |       | implemented on that device.                               |
+-------------------------+-------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
|`FS_TIMEOUT`             | False | The device takes too long to respond                      |
+-------------------------+-------+-----------------------------------------------------------+ 
| `FS_FAIL`               | False | If the parameters given in the url are mot matching the   |
|                         |       | node criteria, the request will fail.                     |
