Products with the `Venice 8` module contain a different directory archive
structure compared to the common modules `Venice 6` or `Venice X`. This fact is
interesting, because the stored files are mostly graphical resources and script
files written in `ECMAScript` by `ecma`_.

To extract (and uncompress) the stored files, you can use the `isu_inspector`
tool or directly execute the ``fsapi.isu`` module. Files that can be used within
this module end with the ``.es.bin`` suffix (`es` for ecmascript).

Allthough, there is no binary structure definition of ECMAScript files available,
this module tries to read and extract data from input files. Decompilation of
`.es.bin` files back to ECMAScript code can be a possible feature for future
releases.
