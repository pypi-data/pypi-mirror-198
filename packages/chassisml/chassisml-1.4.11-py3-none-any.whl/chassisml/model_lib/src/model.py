"""
The required output structure for a successful inference run for a models is the following JSON:

{
    "data": {
        "result": <inference-result>,
        "explanation": <explanation-data>,
        "drift": <drift-data>,
    }
}

The `data` key is required and stores a dictionary which represents the output for a specific input. The only top-level
key within these dictionaries that is required is `result`, however, `explanation` and `drift` are additional keys that
may be included if your particular model supports drift detection or explainability. All three of these keys
(`result`, `explanation`, and `drift`) are required to have a particular format in order to provide platform support.
This format type must be specified in the model.yaml file for the version that you are releasing, and the structure for
this format type must be followed. If no formats are specified, it is possible to define your own custom structure on a
per-model basis.

The required output structure for a failed inference run for a models is the following JSON:

{
    "error_message": <error-message>
}

Here, all error information that you can extract can be loaded into a single string and returned. This could be a JSON
string with a structured error log, or a stack trace dumped to a string.

Specifications:
This section details the currently supported specifications for the "result", "explanation", and "drift" fields of each
successful output JSON. These correspond to specifications selected in the `resultsFormat`, `driftFormat`,
`explanationFormat` of the model.yaml file for the particular version of the model.

* `resultsFormat`:

The currently supported types for resultsFormat, concrete specifications, and descriptions can be found in
grpc_model.src.results_format_specifications.

* `driftFormat`

        This is an optional method that will be attempted to be called when more than one inputs to the model
