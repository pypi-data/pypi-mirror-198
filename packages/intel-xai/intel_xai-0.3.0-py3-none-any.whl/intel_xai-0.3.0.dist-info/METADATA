# Intel® Explainable AI Tools

This repository provides tools for data scientists and MLOps engineers that have requirements specific to AI model interpretability.

## Features
| Core Feature | Description | 
|----------|-----------|
| **Model Card Generator** |  **Allows users to create interactive HTML reports containing model performance and fairness metrics.** |
|**Explainer** | **Allows users to run post-hoc model distillation and visualization methods to examine predictive behavior for both TensorFlow and PyTorch models via a simple Python API including the following modules:** <li> **Attributions**: visualize negative and positive attributions of tabular features, pixels, and word tokens for predictions <li> **CAM**: create heatmaps for CNN image classifications using gradient-weight class activation CAM mapping <li> **Metrics**: Gain insight into models with the measurements and visualizations needed during the machine learning workflow |

## Build and Install
Requirements:
* Linux system (or WSL2 on Windows)
* git
* required python version: 3.9
* `apt-get install build-essential python3-dev`

### Basic Installation:
```
pip install intel-xai
```
### Advanced/Developer Installation:
1. Clone this repo and navigate to the repo directory:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/IntelAI/intel-xai-tools.git

   cd intel-xai-tools
   ```
2. Create and activate a Python3.9 virtual environment using `virtualenv`:
   ```
   python3.9 -m virtualenv xai_env
   source xai_env/bin/activate
   ```

   Or `conda`:
   ```
   conda create --name xai_env python=3.9
   conda activate xai_env
   ```
3. Install this tool with 
   ```
   make install
   ```

## Running Notebooks

Run **example notebooks** that show how to use the explainer and model card generator API in various ML domains and use cases. Notebooks may require additional dependencies listed in their associated README's.
