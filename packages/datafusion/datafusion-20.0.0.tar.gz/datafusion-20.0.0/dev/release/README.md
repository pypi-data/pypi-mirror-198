# DataFusion Python Release Process

Development happens on the `main` branch, and most of the time, we depend on DataFusion using GitHub dependencies
rather than using an official release from crates.io. This allows us to pick up new features and bug fixes frequently
by creating PRs to move to a later revision of the code. It also means we can incrementally make updates that are
required due to changes in DataFusion rather than having a large amount of work to do when the next official release
is available.

When there is a new official release of DataFusion, we update the `main` branch to point to that, update the version
number, and create a new release branch, such as `branch-0.8`. Once this branch is created, we switch the `main` branch
back to using GitHub dependencies. The release activity (such as generating the changelog) can then happen on the
release branch without blocking ongoing development in the `main` branch.

We can cherry-pick commits from the `main` branch into `branch-0.8` as needed and then create new patch releases
from that branch.

## Detailed Guide

### Pre-requisites

Releases can currently only be created by PMC members due to the permissions needed.

You will need a GitHub Personal Access Token. Follow
[these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
to generate one if you do not already have one.

You will need a PyPI API token. Create one at https://test.pypi.org/manage/account/#api-tokens, setting the “Scope” to
“Entire account”.

You will also need access to the [datafusion](https://test.pypi.org/project/datafusion/) project on testpypi.

### Preparing the `main` Branch

Before creating a new release:

- We need to ensure that the main branch does not have any GitHub dependencies
- a PR should be created and merged to update the major version number of the project
- A new release branch should be created, such as `branch-0.8`

### Update CHANGELOG.md

Define release branch (e.g. `branch-0.8`), base version tag (e.g. `0.7.0`) and future version tag (e.g. `0.9.0`). Commits
between the base version tag and the release branch will be used to populate the changelog content.

```bash
# create the changelog
CHANGELOG_GITHUB_TOKEN=<TOKEN> ./dev/release/update_change_log-datafusion-python.sh main 0.8.0 0.7.0
# review change log / edit issues and labels if needed, rerun until you are happy with the result
git commit -a -m 'Create changelog for release'
```

_If you see the error `"You have exceeded a secondary rate limit"` when running this script, try reducing the CPU
allocation to slow the process down and throttle the number of GitHub requests made per minute, by modifying the
value of the `--cpus` argument in the `update_change_log.sh` script._

You can add `invalid` or `development-process` label to exclude items from
release notes.

Send a PR to get these changes merged into the release branch (e.g. `branch-0.8`). If new commits that could change the
change log content landed in the release branch before you could merge the PR, you need to rerun the changelog update
script to regenerate the changelog and update the PR accordingly.

### Preparing a Release Candidate

### Tag the Repository

```bash
git tag 0.8.0-rc1
git push apache 0.8.0-rc1
```

### Create a source release

```bash
./dev/release/create-tarball.sh 0.8.0 1
```

This will also create the email template to send to the mailing list. Here is an example:

```
To: dev@arrow.apache.org
Subject: [VOTE][RUST][DataFusion] Release DataFusion Python Bindings 0.7.0 RC2
Hi,

I would like to propose a release of Apache Arrow DataFusion Python Bindings,
version 0.7.0.

This release candidate is based on commit: bd1b78b6d444b7ab172c6aec23fa58c842a592d7 [1]
The proposed release tarball and signatures are hosted at [2].
The changelog is located at [3].
The Python wheels are located at [4].

Please download, verify checksums and signatures, run the unit tests, and vote
on the release. The vote will be open for at least 72 hours.

Only votes from PMC members are binding, but all members of the community are
encouraged to test the release and vote with "(non-binding)".

The standard verification procedure is documented at https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion-python/blob/main/dev/release/README.md#verifying-release-candidates.

[ ] +1 Release this as Apache Arrow DataFusion Python 0.7.0
[ ] +0
[ ] -1 Do not release this as Apache Arrow DataFusion Python 0.7.0 because...

Here is my vote:

+1

[1]: https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion-python/tree/bd1b78b6d444b7ab172c6aec23fa58c842a592d7
[2]: https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/arrow/apache-arrow-datafusion-python-0.7.0-rc2

[4]: https://test.pypi.org/project/datafusion/0.7.0/
```

Create a draft email using this content, but do not send until after completing the next step.

### Publish Python Artifacts to testpypi

This section assumes some familiarity with publishing Python packages to PyPi. For more information, refer to \
[this tutorial](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/#uploading-the-distribution-archives).

#### Publish Python Wheels to testpypi

Pushing an `rc` tag to the release branch will cause a GitHub Workflow to run that will build the Python wheels.

Go to https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion-python/actions and look for an action named "Python Release Build"
that has run against the pushed tag.

Click on the action and scroll down to the bottom of the page titled "Artifacts". Download `dist.zip`.

Upload the wheels to testpypi.

```bash
unzip dist.zip
python3 -m pip install --upgrade setuptools twine build
python3 -m twine upload --repository testpypi datafusion-0.7.0-cp37-abi3-*.whl
```

When prompted for username, enter `__token__`. When prompted for a password, enter a valid GitHub Personal Access Token

#### Publish Python Source Distribution to testpypi

Download the source tarball created in the previous step, untar it, and run:

```bash
python3 -m build
```

This will create a file named `dist/datafusion-0.7.0.tar.gz`. Upload this to testpypi:

```bash
python3 -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/datafusion-0.7.0.tar.gz
```

### Send the Email

Send the email to start the vote.

## Verifying a Release

Install the release from testpypi:

```bash
pip install --extra-index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ datafusion==0.7.0
```

Try running one of the examples from the top-level README, or write some custom Python code to query some available
data files.

## Publishing a Release

### Publishing Apache Source Release

Once the vote passes, we can publish the release.

Create the source release tarball:

```bash
./dev/release/release-tarball.sh 0.8.0 1
```

### Publishing Python Artifacts to PyPi

Go to the Test PyPI page of Datafusion, and download
[all published artifacts](https://test.pypi.org/project/datafusion/#files) under `dist-release/` directory. Then proceed
uploading them using `twine`:

```bash
twine upload --repository pypi dist-release/*
```

### Publish Python Artifacts to Anaconda

Publishing artifacts to Anaconda is similar to PyPi. First, Download the source tarball created in the previous step and untar it.

```bash
# Assuming you have an existing conda environment named `datafusion-dev` if not see root README for instructions
conda activate datafusion-dev
conda build .
```

This will setup a virtual conda environment and build the artifacts inside of that virtual env. This step can take a few minutes as the entire build, host, and runtime environments are setup. Once complete a local filesystem path will be emitted for the location of the resulting package. Observe that path and copy to your clipboard.

Ex: `/home/conda/envs/datafusion/conda-bld/linux-64/datafusion-0.7.0.tar.bz2`

Now you are ready to publish this resulting package to anaconda.org. This can be accomplished in a few simple steps.

```bash
# First login to Anaconda with the datafusion credentials
anaconda login
# Upload the package
anaconda upload /home/conda/envs/datafusion/conda-bld/linux-64/datafusion-0.7.0.tar.bz2
```

### Push the Release Tag

```bash
git checkout 0.8.0-rc1
git tag 0.8.0
git push apache 0.8.0
```
