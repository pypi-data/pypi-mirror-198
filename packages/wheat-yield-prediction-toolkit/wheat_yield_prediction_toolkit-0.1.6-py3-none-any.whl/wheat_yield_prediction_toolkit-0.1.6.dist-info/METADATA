# Wheat Yield Prediction Toolkit

Are you interested in predicting winter wheat yield in your area? Look no further! The Wheat Yield Prediction Toolkit is a collection of tools for gathering and processing data from various sources to help you make informed predictions about winter wheat yield.

## Overview

The Wheat Yield Prediction Toolkit includes several modules for collecting data from different sources:



- USDA Quick Stats API for yield data
- Gee for remote sensing
- SoilGrids for soil data images
- NASA POWER provider for weather data

This README will guide you through the steps to set up and use the toolkit. Let's get started!
