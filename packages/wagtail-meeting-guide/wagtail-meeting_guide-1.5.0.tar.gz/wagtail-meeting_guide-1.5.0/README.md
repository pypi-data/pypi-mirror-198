# Wagtail Meeting Guide

A Python package compatible with the [Meeting Guide App](https://www.aa.org/pages/en_US/meeting-guide) for [the Wagtail CMS](https://wagtail.io) on the [Django web framework](https://www.djangoproject.com).

## Pre-Requisites

Using this package requires both the Wagtail CMS and Django. Wagtail and Django are fantastic for running your website, but require a developer. If you are new to Django, I would recommend going through both the [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/) and [Wagtail](http://docs.wagtail.io/en/latest/getting_started/tutorial.html) tutorials before trying to use this package.

A Google Geocode API key and MapBox API key are also required. The Google API key is only used in the content management system (typically by administrators), so the free tier should be fine to use.

## Installation to Your Django Project

* Install with the command `pip install wagtail-meeting-guide`
* Add `meeting_guide`, `mptt`, and `wagtailgeowidget` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`.
* Add the following settings:
    * `WAGTAIL_SITE_NAME` (MyCity Intergroup): the name of your website, typically the intergroup.
    * `BASE_URL` (https://AAMyCity.org): the base URL or the website.
* Run migrations: `python manage.py migrate meeting_guide`
* Load Meeting Guide's meeting types: `python manage.py loaddata meeting_guide_types.json`

## Configuration

* Enter the Wagtail CMS, and go to `Settings`, `Meeting Types`.
* Enter your Intergroup's code for each of the Meeting Guide Code Types
* Go to `Regions` and enter your regions; regions can have a parent, so you can nest them. For example, you could have `Philadelphia County` as a region with no parent, and `Center City` as a sub-region with `Philadelphia County` as the parent.

## Including the Meeting Guide in Your Django Template

The API end point for the locations and meetings you create in Wagtail has to be added to your site's root `urls.py`. Add a line like this:

```python
urlpatterns = [
    ...
    path("meetings/", include("meeting_guide.urls")),
    ...
]
```

You can include the Meeting Guide within any Django Template. Here is an example:

```django+html
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% load meeting_guide %}

{% block content %}
    {% meeting_guide %}
{% endblock content %}
```

## More Settings

You can modify the `MEETING_GUIDE` setting in Django's settings to change the defaults in [https://github.com/code4recovery/tsml-ui#advanced-customization](tsml-ui). Here is an example settings block:

```python
# Google Maps, Used by the Wagtail Content Management System
GOOGLE_MAPS_V3_APIKEY = "FAKEoyCFYHEYHUoBLAHBLAHYbRqjBafhI3FAKE"
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_BOUNDS = "39.732679,-77.821655|41.553879,-73.896790"
GEO_WIDGET_DEFAULT_LOCATION = {"lat": 40.0024137, "lng": -75.258117}  # The Philadelphia area
GEO_WIDGET_ZOOM = 14

# Key for MapBox, used by the front end served to users.
MAPBOX_KEY = "YourMaxBoxKeyGoesHere"

# Example of sending settings to tsml-ui
MEETING_GUIDE = {
    "flags": ["X", "TC"],
    "show": {
        "listButtons": True,
    },
    "map": {
        "key": MAPBOX_KEY,
    },
    "strings": {
        "en": {
            "types": {
                "X": "Wheelchair",
                "TC": "Temp Closed",
            },
        },
    },
    "feedback_emails": "manager@your-integroup.org",
}
```

## Downloading Meetings as a PDF

To download the meeting list as a PDF, you must [have wkhtmltopdf installed on your system](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/). The end point for the download is `meeting-guide/download/`.

You can change the print and style options in your Django settings. The options are a Python dictionary while the styles are a string containing CSS:

```python
WAGTAIL_MEETING_GUIDE_PRINT_OPTIONS = {
    'page-width': '100mm',
    'page-height': '120mm',
    'margin-top': '10mm',
    'margin-right': '10mm',
    'margin-bottom': '10mm',
    'margin-left': '10mm',
    'header-left': '[section]: [subsection]',
    'encoding': "UTF-8",
    'no-outline': None
}

WAGTAIL_MEETING_GUIDE_PRINT_STYLES = """
html, td {
  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
  font-size: 9px;
  -webkit-text-size-adjust:100%;
  -ms-text-size-adjust:100%;
  color: red;
}

body {
  margin:0;
}

h1, .h1 {
  font-size: 24px;
}
"""
```
