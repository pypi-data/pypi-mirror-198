    An Application represents a feature available to customers within
    the Lockstep Platform. You can create Applications by working with
    your Lockstep business development manager and publish them on the
    platform so that customers can browse and find your Application on
    the Lockstep Platform Marketplace. When a customer adds an
    Application to their account, they obtain an AppEnrollment which
    represents that customer's instance of this Application. The
    customer-specific AppEnrollment contains a customer's configuration
    data for the Application, which is not customer-specific. See
    [Applications and Enrollments](https://developer.lockstep.io/docs/applications-and-enrollments)
