    """
    The PaymentAppliedSyncModel represents information coming into
    Lockstep from an external financial system or other enterprise
    resource planning system. To import data from an external system,
    convert your original data into the PaymentAppliedSyncModel format
    and call the [Upload Sync File API](https://developer.lockstep.io/reference/post_api-v1-sync-zip).
    This API retrieves all of the data you uploaded in a compressed ZIP
    file and imports it into the Lockstep platform. Once imported, this
    record will be available in the Lockstep API as a
    [PaymentAppliedModel](https://developer.lockstep.io/docs/paymentappliedmodel).
    For more information on writing your own connector, see [Connector
    Data](https://developer.lockstep.io/docs/connector-data).
