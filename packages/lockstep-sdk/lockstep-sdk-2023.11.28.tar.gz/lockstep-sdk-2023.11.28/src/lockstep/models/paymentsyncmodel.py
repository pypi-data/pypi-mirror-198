    """
    The PaymentSyncModel represents information coming into Lockstep
    from an external financial system or other enterprise resource
    planning system. To import data from an external system, convert
    your original data into the PaymentSyncModel format and call the
    [Upload Sync File API](https://developer.lockstep.io/reference/post_api-v1-sync-zip).
    This API retrieves all of the data you uploaded in a compressed ZIP
    file and imports it into the Lockstep platform. Once imported, this
    record will be available in the Lockstep API as a
    [PaymentModel](https://developer.lockstep.io/docs/paymentmodel). For
    more information on writing your own connector, see [Connector
    Data](https://developer.lockstep.io/docs/connector-data).
