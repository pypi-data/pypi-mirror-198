**Theia-picker** provides everything to **download efficiently 
[theia products](https://www.theia-land.fr/en/products/)**.
In particular, it is able to **download only selected files 
from the remote archive**, without the entire data (Typically, 
a single spectral band of a S2 product).

Read the **[documentation](https://umr-tetis.gitlab.irstea.page/theia-picker)** to know more.
