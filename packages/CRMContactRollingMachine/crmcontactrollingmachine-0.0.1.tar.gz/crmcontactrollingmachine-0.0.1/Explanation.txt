We in the CRM are trying to use people api to automatically send out a contact list to each of our organizations accounts. To do this we will be using the people api to access the contacts on a master account then download it and save it to a file. After doing so we will use that file to upload the contacts to each of the accounts provided by our organization. Each of the accounts will either end in @missionary.org or be ones that are personally owned for testing purposes. We will then delete the file with all the contacts saved to it. All the users in our organization have given permission to use their information for these purposes and are over the age of 18.
