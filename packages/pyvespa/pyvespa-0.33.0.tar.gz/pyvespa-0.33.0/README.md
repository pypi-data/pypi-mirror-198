[Vespa](https://vespa.ai/) is the scalable open-sourced serving engine that enables users to store,
compute and rank big data at user serving time.
`pyvespa` provides a python API to Vespa.
It allows users to create, modify, deploy and interact with running Vespa instances.
The main goal of the library is to allow for faster prototyping
and to facilitate Machine Learning experiments for Vespa applications -
also see [learntorank](https://github.com/vespa-engine/learntorank).

* Run the following command from the pyvespa root directory to create the library files

```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install twine wheel

python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
``` 

* Make sure you have the python library `twine` installed and access to the pyvespa project on PyPI.
  Run the following command to send the library to PyPI, it requires your username and password:

```
python3 -m twine upload dist/*
```

At this point, the latest package has been released. 

* Please, create a new release tag on the Github project (https://github.com/vespa-engine/pyvespa/releases/new)
  with a summary of the code changes included in the release.
  Look at previous release notes and follow the same pattern.
