# OpenCDMS devcontainer

> **NOTE:** You're looking at the `opencdms/.devcontainer/README.md` introduction

This environment is intended for software developers who would like to contribute to OpenCDMS development.

If you are looking for the *OpenCDMS workshop* then close this environment and open the [opencdms-workshop codespace](https://github.com/opencdms/opencdms-workshop) instead.

## Overview

> TODO: Add video introduction here

> **Warning:** When developing inside any container you have to be especially careful not to accidently lose any changes that you've made by closing/deleting the container before commiting and pushing your changes.
> 
> In addition, in this particular devcontainer, you may not receive warnings for changes made in all repositories in `/workspaces/` (since `workspaces/opencdms` is the primary repository for the container).
