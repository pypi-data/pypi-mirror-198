"""
The Python time standard uses POSIX (UNIX) time which is defined relative
to Jan 1, 1970.  Python uses floating point seconds to express time.
This module defines a much simpler 64-bit fixed point integer for
representing time which is much friendlier for microcontrollers.
The value is 34Q30 with the upper 34 bits
to represent whole seconds and the lower 30 bits to represent fractional
seconds.  A value of 2**30 (1 << 30) represents 1 second.  This
representation gives a resolution of 2 ** -30 (approximately 1 nanosecond)
and a range of +/- 2 ** 33 (approximately 272 years).  The value is
signed to allow for simple arithmetic on the time either as a fixed value
or as deltas.
