Correct how coordinate transformations are applied in the inverse telescope model. The default Mueller Matrix will now
place data into the same coordinate frame used by SDO and HINODE (-Q and +Q will be aligned parallel and perpendicular to the
central meridian of the Sun, respectively). It will also apply a sign flip to U and V. All of these options can still be turned off if desired.
