@article{Eisenlohr2015,
abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a simulation formalism for determining the Optical Properties of Textured Optical Sheets (OPTOS). Our matrix-based method allows for the computationally-efficient calculation of non-coherent light propagation and absorption in thick textured sheets, especially solar cells, featuring different textures on front and rear side that may operate in different optical regimes. Within the simulated system, the angular power distribution is represented by a vector. This light distribution is modified by interaction with the surfaces of the textured sheets, which are described by redistribution matrices. These matrices can be calculated for each individual surface texture with the most appropriate technique. Depending on the feature size of the texture, for example, either ray- or wave-optical methods can be used. The comparison of the simulated absorption in a sheet of silicon for a variety of surface textures, both with the results from other simulation techniques and experimentally measured data, shows very good agreement. To demonstrate the versatility of this newly-developed approach, the absorption in silicon sheets with a large-scale structure (V-grooves) at the front side and a small-scale structure (diffraction grating) at the rear side is calculated. Moreover, with minimal computational effort, a thickness parameter variation is performed.},

@article{Tucher2015,
abstract = {In this paper we introduce the three-dimensional formulation of the OPTOS formalism, a matrix-based method that allows for the efficient simulation of non-coherent light propagation and absorption in thick textured sheets. As application examples, we calculate the absorptance of solar cells featuring textures on front and rear side with different feature sizes operating in different optical regimes. A discretization of polar and azimuth angle enables a three-dimensional description of systems with arbitrary surface textures. We present redistribution matrices for 3D surface textures, including pyramidal textures, binary crossed gratings and a Lambertian scatterer. The results of the OPTOS simulations for silicon sheets with different combinations of these surfaces are in accordance with both optical measurements and results based on established simulation methods like ray tracing. Using OPTOS, we show that the integration of a diffractive grating at the rear side of a silicon solar cell featuring a pyramidal front side results in absorption close to the Yablonovitch Limit enhancing the photocurrent density by 0.6 mA/cm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} for a 200 µm thick cell.},

@article{Alonso-Alvarez2019c,
abstract = {The aim of this work is to evaluate whether silicon heterojunction solar cells, lacking highly emissive, heavily doped silicon layers, could be better candidates for hybrid photovoltaic thermal collectors than standard aluminium-diffused back contact solar cells. To this end, the near and mid infrared emissivity of full silicon heterojunction solar cells, as well as of its constituent materials – crystalline silicon wafer, indium tin oxide, n-, i- and p-type amorphous silicon – have been assessed by means of ellipsometry and FTIR. The experimental results show that the thermal emissivity of these cells is actually as high as in the more traditional structures, {\~{}}80{\%} at 8 $\mu$m. Detailed optical modelling combining raytracing and transfer matrix formalism shows that the emissivity in these cells originates in the transparent conductive oxide layers themselves, where the doping is not high enough to result in a reflection that exceeds the increased free carrier absorption. Further modelling suggests that it is possible to obtain lower emissivity solar cells, but that a careful optimization of the transparent conductive layer needs to be done to avoid hindering the photovoltaic performance.},

@article{Lipovsek2011,
abstract = {An optical model for simulation of thin-film photovoltaic devices with thick surface-textured front components is presented. The model is based on the combination of incoherent geometric optics and coherent wave optics analysis, which are employed separately to simulate light propagation through the front textured component and the bottom flat thin-film component of the device, respectively. The verified model is implemented into the optical simulator CROWM, which is employed to study the light-trapping potential of the front surface-textured protective glass in thin-film photovoltaic modules. The results show that the texturisation in the range of millimetres significantly improves the quantum efficiency of the PV module, which results in 14.3 % higher JSC compared to the conventional module with flat protective glass.},
