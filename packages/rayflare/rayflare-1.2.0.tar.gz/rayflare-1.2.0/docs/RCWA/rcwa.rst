Rigorous coupled-wave analysis
===============================
.. _rcwa:

There are two distinct uses of the rigorous coupled-wave analysis code: to create redistribution matrices for the matrix framework,
and to define and calculate structures which are treated in their entirety by RCWA (so the matrix framework is not used).
The function :literal:`RCWA` is used to create redistribution matrices, while the class :literal:`rcwa_structure` is used to define
structures for RCWA calculations.
