<p>This plugin allows you to manage most of the work that can be done in a 
Cutevariant project by writing and executing VQL queries.</p>

<p>VQL is a <i>Domain Specific Language</i>, its main purpose is to filter variants
in the same fashion as a SQL query.</p>


<p>Although the plugin offers auto-completion 
and syntax highlighting, if you want to have more details on how to write your own VQL queries,
as well as the keywords of the language, please see the project wiki page:</p>
