def receipt():
    """
    This function takes user inputs for a purchase and prints out a receipt.

    The function first prints out some introductory messages and explains the purpose of the project.
    It then prompts the user for inputs such as their name, the name of the purchased item, the price and quantity of the item, and the tax rate.
    The function then calculates the subtotal, tax amount, and total cost of the purchase based on the user's inputs.
    Finally, the function prints out a formatted receipt containing the user's inputs and the calculated values.

    Parameters:
    None

    Returns:
    None
