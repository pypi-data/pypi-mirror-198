# Step response with NIDAQ boards

**NOTE 1**: before working with PYDAQ, device driver should be installed and working correctly as a DAQ (Data Acquisition) device

## Step Response using Graphical User Interface (GUI)

Using GUI for step response is really straighforward and require only 
three LOC (lines of code):

```python
from pydaq.step_response import Step_response

# Class Step_Response
s = Step_response()

# Method step_response_nidaq_gui
s.step_response_nidaq_gui()
```

After this command, the following screen will show up, where the 
user is able to define parameters and start to acquire data.

The user is now able to select desired NIDAQ device, analog input and 
analog output channel, as well as analog input terminal configuration.
Step range and sample period can be adjusted along with session duration. 
Step will be applied in the defined time. Also, the user will define if 
the data will or not be plotted and saved. 

## Step Response using command line

It will be presented how to use Step_response (and step_response_nidaq) to 
perform a step response experiment using an NIDAQ board. 

Firstly, import library and define parameters:  

```python
# Importing PYDAQ
from pydaq.step_response import Step_response

# Defining parameters
device_name = "Dev1"
ao_channel_used = "ao0"
ai_channel_used = "ai0"
sample_period_in_seconds = 1
session_duration_in_seconds = 10.0
step_time_in_seconds = 3.0
step_min_in_volts = 0
step_max_in_volts = 5
terminal_configuration = 'Diff'
will_plot = True
```

Then, instantiate a class with defined parametes and send the data

```python
# Class Get_data
s = Step_response(device=device_name, 
                  ao_channel= ao_channel_used, 
                  ai_channel=ai_channel_used, 
                  ts=sample_period_in_seconds, 
                  session_duration=session_duration_in_seconds, 
                  step_time=step_time_in_seconds, 
                  step_min=step_min_in_volts, 
                  step_max=step_max_in_volts,
                  terminal= terminal_configuration, 
                  plot=will_plot)

# Method step_response_nidaq
s.step_response_nidaq()
```

If you choose to plot you can see the data sent on screen, i.e:
