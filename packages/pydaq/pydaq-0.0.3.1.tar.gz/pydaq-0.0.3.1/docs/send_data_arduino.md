# Sending Data with Arduino Boards

**NOTE 1**: before working with PYDAQ, device driver should be installed and working correctly as a DAQ (Data Acquisition) device

**NOTE 2**: To acquire/send data with arduino, the code provided here (located at [arduino_code](https://github.com/samirmartins/pydaq/tree/main/pydaq/arduino_code)) 
should be uploaded in Arduino first. Default output port is 13 and this port can be changed in the above mentioned code.
This code only works with digital output, since this is a limitation of Arduino Boards.

**NOTE 3**: Since are used digital output ports, the output will be
0V if data < 2.5 and 5V otherwise. 

## Sending Data using Graphical User Interface (GUI)

Using GUI to send data is really straighforward and require only 
three LOC (lines of code):

```python
from pydaq.send_data import Send_data

# Class Send_data
s = Send_data()

# Method send_data_arduino_gui
s.send_data_arduino_gui()
```

After this command, the following screen will show up, where the 
user is able to define parameters and start to acquire data.

The user is now able to select desired Arduino and sample period. Also, 
the user will define if the data will or not be plotted. The data that 
will be sent should be in the range (0-5V).

Data should be formated as one data 
per line and saved as a .dat file. After
configuration is done, the user only need to click on **SEND DATA** button to start the process.

## Sending data using command line

It will be presented how to use Send_data (and send_data_arduino) to 
send a signal using an Arduino board. 

Firstly, import library and define parameters: 

```python
# Importing PYDAQ
from pydaq.send_data import Send_data

# Defining parameters
sample_period_in_seconds = 1
data = [0,0,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,5] # It can be either a list or a numpy array
com_port_arduino = 'COM3'
will_plot = True
```

Then, instantiate a class with defined parametes and send the data

```python
# Class Send_data
s = Send_data(data = data, 
              com = com_port_arduino, 
              ts = sample_period_in_seconds)

# Method send_data_arduino()
s.send_data_arduino()


```

If you choose to plot you can see the data sent on screen, i.e:
