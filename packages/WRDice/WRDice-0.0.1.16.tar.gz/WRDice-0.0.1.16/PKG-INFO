# WRDice
Backend for WRBattleSim

## Installation
Using pipy:

```
python -m pip install wrdice
```

## Usage

Units are added for land, air and sea in the color order
> [yellow, blue, green, red, black]

Units are assigned to differnet stances either by their numerical value or -1 to assign all units to a given stance
> stances = [defensive/esocort/anti-air], [offensive/ground]

```python

Build simulation and run with given army setups.

```python
sim = Simulate(None, None)
sim.run(CombatSystem.WarRoomV2, 
                config=config, 
                armyA=A,
                armyB=B)
sim.eval_statistics()
```
