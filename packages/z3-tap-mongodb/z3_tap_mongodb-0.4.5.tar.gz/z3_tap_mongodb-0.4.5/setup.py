First, rather than expose a very specific set of configuration options for the underlying pymongo driver, we expose all possible arguments by accepting an object underneath the `mongo` key which pass all kwargs straight through to the driver. There are over 40 configurable kwargs available as seen [here](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/pymongo/mongo_client.html#module-pymongo.mongo_client). This gives it more flexibility in contrast to a constrained interface. Secondly, this tap has three output modes configurable via `strategy: raw | envelope | infer`. \n\n- **Strategy 1** (`strategy: raw`) merely outputs data as-is with an `additonalProperties: true` schema. This is ideal for loading to unstructured sources such as blob storage where it may be preferable to keep documents exactly as they are. \n\n- **Strategy 2** (`strategy: envelope`) will wrap the document in a `document` key and output a fixed schema. The schema will use `type: object` and the target should be able to handle unstructured data, ie. via a VARIANT/JSON column.\n\n- **Strategy 3** (`strategy: infer`) infers the schema of each collection from a configurable sample size of records. This allows the tap to work with strongly typed destinations. This is an attractive option. Particularly when we don\'t expect the documents to vary dramatically.\n\nThe last differentiator is the minimal code footprint in comparison to existing Mongo taps. I hope that this tap exemplifies how we can use as little code as possible with the existing plumbing in the SDK. The SDK means the tap supports the `BATCH` specification out of the box and is able to receive ongoing updates and improvements as the SDK continues to mature.\n\n## Installation\n\nThe package on pypi is named `z3-tap-mongodb` but the executable it ships with is simply `tap-mongodb`. This allows me to release work without concerns of naming conflicts on the package index.\n\n```bash\n# Use pipx or pip\npipx install z3-tap-mongodb\n# Verify it is installed\ntap-mongodb --version\n```\n\n## Incremental Syncs\n\nWe support incremental syncs on a collection by collection basis. All this requires is the developer adding a `replication_key` to the catalog for a stream. After dumping the `tap-mongodb --config ... --discover > catalog.json`, you can modify the catalog and version control it for ongoing use. If using meltano, you can use the `metadata` key to update the catalog dynamically achieving the same affect. One caveat of our incrementality is that this relies on an alphanumerically sortable replication key. This accounts for a majority of use cases but there are some edge cases. Integer based replication keys (such as epochs) work fine obviously, ISO formatted dates work fine, but any other format may not work as expected.\n\n## Settings\n\n| Setting                 | Required | Default | Description |\n|:------------------------|:--------:|:-------:|:------------|\n| mongo                   | True     | None    | These props are passed directly to pymongo MongoClient allowing the tap user full flexibility not provided in any other Mongo tap since every kwarg can be tuned. |\n| stream_prefix           | False    |         | Optionally add a prefix for all streams, useful if ingesting from multiple shards/clusters via independent tap-mongodb configs. This is applied during catalog generation. Regenerate the catalog to apply a new stream prefix. |\n| optional_replication_key| False    |       0 | This setting allows the tap to continue processing if a document is missing the replication key. Useful if a very small percentage of documents are missing the property. |\n| database_includes       | False    | None    | A list of databases to include. If this list is empty, all databases will be included. |\n| database_excludes       | False    | None    | A list of databases to exclude. If this list is empty, no databases will be excluded. |\n| strategy                | False    |   "raw" | The strategy to use for schema resolution. Defaults to \'raw\'. The \'raw\' strategy uses a relaxed schema using additionalProperties: true to accept the document as-is leaving the target to respect it. Useful for blob or jsonl. The \'envelope\' strategy will envelope the document under a key named `document`. The target should use a variant type for this key. The \'infer\' strategy will infer the schema from the data based on a configurable number of documents. |\n| infer_schema_max_docs   | False    |    2000 | The maximum number of documents to sample when inferring the schema. This is only used when `strategy` is set to `infer`. |\n| batch_config            | False    | None    | Batch configuration as defined [here](https://sdk.meltano.com/en/latest/batch.html#batch-configuration) |\n| stream_maps             | False    | None    |             |\n| stream_map_config       | False    | None    | User-defined config values to be used within map expressions. |\n| flattening_enabled      | False    | None    | \'True\' to enable schema flattening and automatically expand nested properties. |\n| flattening_max_depth    | False    | None    | The max depth to flatten schemas. |\n\nA full list of supported settings and capabilities is available by running: `tap-mongodb --about`\n\n### Configure using environment variables\n\nThis Singer tap will automatically import any environment variables within the working directory\'s\n`.env` if the `--config=ENV` is provided, such that config values will be considered if a matching\nenvironment variable is set either in the terminal context or in the `.env` file.\n\n### Capabilities\n\n* `batch`\n* `catalog`\n* `state`\n* `discover`\n* `about`\n* `stream-maps`\n* `schema-flattening`\n\n## Usage\n\nYou can easily run `tap-mongodb` by itself or in a pipeline using [Meltano](https://meltano.com/).\n\n### Executing the Tap Directly\n\n```bash\ntap-mongodb --version\ntap-mongodb --help\ntap-mongodb --config CONFIG --discover > ./catalog.json\n```\n\n## Developer Resources\n\n### Initialize your Development Environment\n\n```bash\npipx install poetry\npoetry install\n```\n\n### Create and Run Tests\n\nCreate tests within the `tap_mongodb/tests` subfolder and\n  then run:\n\n```bash\npoetry run pytest\n```\n\nYou can also test the `tap-mongodb` CLI interface directly using `poetry run`:\n\n```bash\npoetry run tap-mongodb --help\n```\n\n### Testing with [Meltano](https://www.meltano.com)\n\n_**Note:** This tap will work in any Singer environment and does not require Meltano.\nExamples here are for convenience and to streamline end-to-end orchestration scenarios._\n\nYour project comes with a custom `meltano.yml` project file already created. Open the `meltano.yml` and follow any _"TODO"_ items listed in\nthe file.\n\nNext, install Meltano (if you haven\'t already) and any needed plugins:\n\n```bash\n# Install meltano\npipx install meltano\n# Initialize meltano within this directory\ncd tap-mongodb\nmeltano install\n```\n\nNow you can test and orchestrate using Meltano:\n\n```bash\n# Test invocation:\nmeltano invoke tap-mongodb --version\n# OR run a test `elt` pipeline:\nmeltano elt tap-mongodb target-jsonl\n```\n\n### SDK Dev Guide\n\nSee the [dev guide](https://sdk.meltano.com/en/latest/dev_guide.html) for more instructions on how to use the SDK to\ndevelop your own taps and targets.\n\nBuilt with the [Meltano Tap SDK](https://sdk.meltano.com) for Singer Taps.\n',
