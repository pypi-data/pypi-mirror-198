    Set of options to specify the

    and/or host application.
  specific_mcpd : ExistingMcpdInstance or None
    By using find_mdf_hosts() you can find out if multiple applications are

    connect to.
  mdf_licence : str
    Licence string to use for mcpd connection.
    A generic default will be used that relies on host application licensing
    to operate.
  mcpd_licence : str
    Licence string for the mcpd itself. This is used when creating a new mcpd.
    The standard behaviour for the mcpd is to require the MDF140 feature code,
