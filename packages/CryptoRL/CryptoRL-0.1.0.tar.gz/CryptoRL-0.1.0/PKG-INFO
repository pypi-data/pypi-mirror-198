## Overview
CryptoRL will use popular deep reinforcement learning algorithms and machine learning algorithms to do cryptocurrency trading.

## Installation

Run ```pip install cryptorl``` to install CryptoRL.

## Usage

To fetch data, please use the functions in *data.py*.

With well processed data, you can use *env_crypto.py* to construct crypto market environment.
