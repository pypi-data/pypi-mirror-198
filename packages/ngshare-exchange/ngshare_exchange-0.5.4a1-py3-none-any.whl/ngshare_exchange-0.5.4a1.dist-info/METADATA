Custom [nbgrader](https://github.com/jupyter/nbgrader) exchange to be used with [ngshare](https://github.com/LibreTexts/ngshare). This should be installed in the singleuser image of [Z2JH](https://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s) to allow the users to use ngshare.

# Installation instructions

To install this and `ngshare`, see the instructions on [Read the Docs](https://ngshare.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/install.html).

# ngshare Course Management

To manage students in your course, please don't use formgrader's web interface since it doesn't use ngshare. Instead, use the `ngshare-course-management` command that gets installed with this package. Please [read the documentation](https://ngshare.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/course_management.html) for instructions on how to use this tool.
