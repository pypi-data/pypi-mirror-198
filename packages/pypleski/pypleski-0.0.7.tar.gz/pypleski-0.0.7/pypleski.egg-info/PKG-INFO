#  Managers module deprecated.

The managers module was removed with version 0.0.5.

Use the PleskApiClient Class's request method to retrieve in conjunction with the several plypleski modules functions.

We moved away from building ManagerClasses and instead provide a functions based approach

this allows usage like this and makes managers obsolete
```
python
from pypleski.core import PleskApiClient
from pypleski.datbase import get_database

#create client object
client = PleskApiClient("localhost") 

#add your token or use set_credentials method
client.set_access_token("IamAValidTokenLOL") 

#make your request
datbase_info = client.request(get_database("webspace-name", "domain.name"))

#print out the response
print(database_info)
```
