**Custom map widgets for creating interactive maps**

The **mapwidget** package provides a set of custom map widgets for creating interactive maps in a Jupyter environment using different JavaScript mapping libraries, such as [cesium](https://cesium.com/), [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/), [mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/), [maplibre](https://maplibre.org/), and [openlayers](https://openlayers.org/). The widgets are built on top of the [anywidget](https://github.com/manzt/anywidget) Python package.
