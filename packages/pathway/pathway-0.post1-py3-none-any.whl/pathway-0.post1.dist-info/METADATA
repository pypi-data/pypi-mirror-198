# Welcome to [Pathway](https://pathway.com)!

**Pathway is a data processing framework which takes care of streaming data updates for you.**

Pathway features a Python programming API and a scalable stream processing engine.

It is used to build:

* Data engineering pipelines: Smart-transformation in ELT / ETL.
* Data apps for simulation (what-if scenario testing).
* Realtime analytics: low-latency analytics on realtime event streaming data.

# What data does Pathway work with?

Pathway is specifically designed to store, process, and output any mix of:
* Pure-SQL data.
* Time series data.
* IoT messages (harmonized).
* Event stream data.
* Spatiotemporal data (things that move).
* Graph and ontologies data.
