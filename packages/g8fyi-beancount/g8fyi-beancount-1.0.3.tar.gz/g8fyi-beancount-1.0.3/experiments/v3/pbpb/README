Switch to pybind11_protobuf because since 3.11, PyFrameObject is not exposed
anymore, and pyext is deprecated and will not be ported to work with the missing
type. The previous approach is doomed... no choice. Have to switch to
pybind11_protobuf.

On the positive side, I tested pybind11_protobuf with 3.12.0a3 and the tests
run.

This directory is a prototype of using the new approach.
This has to be ported to the beancount/cparser location.
