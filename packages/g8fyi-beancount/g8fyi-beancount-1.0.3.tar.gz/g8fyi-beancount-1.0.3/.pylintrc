# Disable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). You
# can either give multiple identifiers separated by comma (,) or put this
# option multiple times (only on the command line, not in the configuration
# file where it should appear only once).You can also use "--disable=all" to
# disable everything first and then reenable specific checks. For example, if
# you want to run only the similarities checker, you can use "--disable=all
# --enable=similarities". If you want to run only the classes checker, but have
# no Warning level messages displayed, use"--disable=all --enable=classes
# --disable=W"

# I like most of these... reenable one by one.

[TYPECHECK]

# Tells whether missing members accessed in mixin class should be ignored. A

# List of members which are set dynamically and missed by pylint inference
# system, and so shouldn't trigger E0201 when accessed. Python regular
