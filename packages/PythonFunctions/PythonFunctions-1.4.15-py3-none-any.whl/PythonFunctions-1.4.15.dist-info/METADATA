# Functions

This is a gigantic folder, with multiple functions for multiple use cases. The only folder that you will need, is [PythonFunctions](./src/PythonFunctions/).

## Documentation

Every file has it own documentation, which can be found here: [Documentation](https://python-functions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Expanding

This file is still in development and more is to come! If you want to contribute, follow the same file structure and submit a pull request.
What you see now is not the final version.

## Contributing

Please read [Contributing.md](Contribution.md)
