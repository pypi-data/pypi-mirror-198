# Monte Carlo Contracts

[![PyPI package](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/monte-carlo-contracts)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/monte-carlo-contracts)

Composable financial contracts with Monte Carlo valuation.
This module employs ideas from [How to Write a Financial Contract](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.14.7885) by S. L. Peyton Jones and J-M. Eber.
However, the implementation is not based on functional programming but rather using an object oriented approach.
Also, this implementation is tailored towards Monte Carlo based cashflow generation whereas the paper favours more general methods.

## Features
* Composition of financial contracts using elementary contracts `Zero`, `One`, `Give`, `Scale`, `And`, `When`, `Cond`, `Anytime`, `Until` and `Delay`
* Boolean and real valued observables (stochastic processes) to be referenced by contracts
* Cashflow generation for composed contracts given simulation models on fixed dategrids

## Examples
* [Equity Options](examples/Equity%20Options.ipynb)
* [FX Options](examples/FX%20Options.ipynb)
* [Working with Observables](examples/Observables.ipynb)
* [Cashflow types](examples/Cashflows.ipynb)

## Install

You can install `monte-carlo-contracts` using `pip` with

```bash
pip3 install monte-carlo-contracts
```

or you can simply download `mcc.py` and then run it using `python3` with

```bash
python3 mcc.py
```

## History

### 0.10.0 (not yet)
* ToDo: Add new `Exchange(currency, contract)` contract
* ToDo: Modify FX options examples to use `Exchange` for cash settlement

### 0.9.0 (not yet)
* ToDo: Split `mcc.py` into multiple modules forming package `mcc`
* ToDo: Split tests into multiple modules

### 0.8.0 (2023-03-20)
* **BREAKING CHANGE**: `Contract` now inherits from `ResolvableContract` instead of the other way round
* **BREAKING CHANGE**: `And` and `Or` contracts now accept more than two contracts to be combined; these have equivalent semantics to nested `And` or `Or` contracts and allow for flat structures to improve readability
* Add `Delay(observableBool, contract)` contract to delay cashflows to a later point in time (main use case is FX payment offset)
* First steps towards model requirements (yet incomplete)
* Fix cashflow generation for nested contracts

### 0.7.0 (2022-03-13)
* **BREAKING CHANGE**: `ObservableFloat.simulate` and `ObservableBool.simulate` now accept a `DateIndex` `first_observation_idx` as first argument, `Contract` classes will pass `acquisition_idx`; this allows observations to depend on the time of entering a contract, e.g. "maximum spot since acquisition"
* **BREAKING CHANGE**: `FixedAfter` fixes composed observable after (including) `first_observation_idx`, not from the beginning
* Add operator overloading for `Contract` classes, i.e. you can now do `One("USD") - One("EUR") | 1.2 * One("GBP")` instead of `Or(And(One("USD"), Give(One("EUR"))), Scale(1.2, One("GBP")))`
* `Maximum` and `Minimum` observables to observe the larger and smaller value of two observables at the same time on the same path
* `RunningMax` and `RunningMin` observables to observe running extreme values from `first_observation_idx` onwards
* Support Python 3.10
* Make use of type annotations added to numpy

### 0.6.0 (2022-03-04)

* **BREAKING CHANGE**: Make `SimpleCashflows` a `pandas.DataFrame`
* Run notebooks in automated tests using [nbval](https://github.com/computationalmodelling/nbval)
* Migrate from travis-ci to [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/luphord/monte-carlo-contracts/actions)
* Explicitly support Python 3.8 and 3.9
* Move history to HISTORY.md

### 0.5.0 (2020-11-08)

* **BREAKING CHANGE**: Add `simulated_rates` to `Model` (included in constructor);
  pass an empty dict for `simulated_rates` to adapt your code
* **BREAKING CHANGE**: `BrownianMotion` and `GeometricBrownianMotion` generalized to
  dynamic mean/drift; pass `mu_t = lambda t: mu * t` to adapt your code
* `LinearRate` observable supported by `TermStructureModel`
* First steps towards term structure models
* `FixedAfter` observable to keep an observable fixed after a condition is true
* Observables support arithmetic operations (binary `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**` and unary `-`)
  with other observables as well as constants (also right operators work)
* [Working with Observables](examples/Observables.ipynb) example notebook

### 0.4.0 (2020-11-04)

* Discounting (`Model.discount`)
* Evaluation (`Model.evaluate`)
* String representations for contracts and observables

### 0.3.0 (2020-10-23)
* Simulation of basic contract `Until`
* Currency conversion of `IndexedCashflows`
* `Or` contract supports multiple currencies
* `ObservableFloat` supports `<`, `<=`, `>` and `>=` operators with `float` or other `ObservableFloat` instances
* `ObservableBool` supports `~`, `&` and `|` operators for combined conditions
* [Equity Options](examples/Equity%20Options.ipynb) and [FX Options](examples/FX%20Options.ipynb) examples

### 0.2.0 (2020-10-11)
* Simulation of basic contracts `Zero`, `One`, `Give`, `Scale`, `And`, `When` and `Cond`
* Partial simulation of `Or` contract
* Float observables `Stock` and `FX`
* Boolean observables `At`
* `SimulatedCashflows` and model-bound `IndexedCashflows` to represent cashflows
* Basic `Model` allowing the generation of cashflows for the contracts above

### 0.1.0 (2020-09-22)
* Created using [cookiecutter-pyscript](https://github.com/luphord/cookiecutter-pyscript)
