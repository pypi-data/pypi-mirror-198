## Powerchat
Powerchat is a Python command-line tool that allows you to list and view the contents of all `.py` and `.md` files in a directory and its subdirectories. It also provides other useful features, such as generating pull request descriptions and suggesting updates to a README.md file based on Git diff or full file contents.

## Installation
To install Powerchat, clone the repository and install the dependencies using Poetry:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/powerchat.git
cd powerchat
poetry install
```

This will install all the required dependencies and create a virtual environment for Powerchat.

To activate the virtual environment, run:
```
poetry shell
```

Now you can run Powerchat from the command line with the `python src/main.py` command.
