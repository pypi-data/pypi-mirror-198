Dynamical Network Analysis
===========================

This package was built to provide an updated and enhanced Python implementation
of the Dynamical Network Analysis method, for the analysis of Molecular Dynamics
simulations. The package was optimized for interactive use through Jupyter
Notebooks (see :ref:`Tutorial <Tutorial>`), and allows for extensive
customization of analysis to suit research-specific needs.
