## Introduction
This is a python repository dedicated to the development of the Near-Infrared Guide Star Catalog (IRGSC) for the Adaptive Optics (AO) observations of the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) project. This package generates the catalog by computing the NIR magnitudes of the optical stellar sources in the PANSTARSS DR2 data.

# Packages
## tmt-irgsc:
A python package aimed to compute the NIR magnitudes of the optical sources in the PANSTARRS data by modelling them with the Kurucz, Castelli-Kurucz and Phoenix Stellar Atmospheric models. This package also validates the computed NIR magnitudes with the observed NIR data from UKIDSS (if it is available). The methodology implemented in this paython package is implemented on twenty test-fields across the TMT's observable sky. Most of the sources have the computed NIR magnitudes similar to the observed. The generated catalog contains astrometric information from GAIA DR3 as well.


### Installation
```
pip install tmt-irgsc

```

# Usage
```
 class IRGSC
```
This class is defined by importing tmt-irgsc module and passing the R.A. and Decl. arguments. In version 1.0 of this package, the catalog is generated using the optimal method described in the work report (link). 

```
import Generate_IRGSC
```

The module Generate_IRGSC(ra, dec) is the module that generates the catalog after importing the IRGSC library. This module alerts if there is no observed NIR UKIDSS data for the given field. Irrespective of whether UKIDSS data is available or not, this module generates the catalog using the optical PANSTARRS data from 3pi steradian survey.

```
import Validate
```
The module Validate(ra,dec) is the module that validates the computed NIR magnitudes after importing the IRGSC library. This module first checks whether the UKIDSS observed NIR data can be obtained for the given field.
