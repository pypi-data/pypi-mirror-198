def get_numeric_frequency(freq):
    """
    Return the frequency of a time series in numeric format.

    The function returns the frequency of a time series in numeric format. This is useful when working with
    forecasting libraries that require the frequency to be a number instead of a string.

    If frequency has multiple seasonalities, for example Daily and Hourly, returns a list with all periods.

    Args:
        freq (str): A string specifying the frequency of the time series.
        Valid values are:
        'Y' (yearly), 'A' (annually), 'Q' (quarterly), 'M' (monthly), 'W' (weekly), 'D' (daily), or 'H' (hourly).

    Returns:
        int: The frequency of the time series in numeric format if frequency has only one seasonalities.
        list: A list with all periods if frequency has multiple seasonalities.
