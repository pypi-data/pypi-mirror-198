class GetVisuals2D(gv2d.GetVisuals2D):

        """
        Class which gets 2D attributes and adds them to a `Visuals2D` objects, such that they are plotted on 2D figures.

        For a visual to be extracted and added for plotting, it must have a `True` value in its corresponding entry in
        the `Include2D` object. If this entry is `False`, the `GetVisuals2D.get` method returns a None and the
        attribute is omitted from the plot.

        The `GetVisuals2D` class adds new visuals to a pre-existing `Visuals2D` object that is passed to
        its `__init__` method. This only adds a new entry if the visual are not already in this object.

        Parameters
        ----------
        include
            Sets which 2D visuals are included on the figure that is to be plotted (only entries which are `True`
            are extracted via the `GetVisuals2D` object).
        visuals
            The pre-existing visuals of the plotter which new visuals are added too via the `GetVisuals2D` class.

        """
        From a `Tracer` get the attributes that can be plotted and returns them in a `Visuals2D` object.

        Only attributes with `True` entries in the `Include` object are extracted.

        From a tracer the following attributes can be extracted for plotting:

        - origin: the (y,x) origin of the coordinate system used to plot the light object's quantities in 2D.
        - border: the border of the mask of the grid used to plot the light object's quantities in 2D.
        - light profile centres: the (y,x) centre of every `LightProfile` in the object.
        - mass profile centres: the (y,x) centre of every `MassProfile` in the object.
        - critical curves: the critical curves of all of the tracer's mass profiles combined.
        - caustics: the caustics of all of the tracer's mass profiles combined.

        When plotting a `Tracer` it is common for plots to only display quantities corresponding to one plane at a time
        (e.g. the convergence in the image plane, the source in the source plane). Therefore, quantities are only
        extracted from one plane, specified by the  input `plane_index`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        tracer
            The `Tracer` object which has attributes extracted for plotting.
        grid
            The 2D grid of (y,x) coordinates used to plot the tracer's quantities in 2D.
        plane_index
            The index of the plane in the tracer which is used to extract quantities, as only one plane is plotted
            at a time.

        Returns
        -------
        vis.Visuals2D
            A collection of attributes that can be plotted by a `Plotter` object.
